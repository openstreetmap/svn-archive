The Debian Package openstreetmap
----------------------------

This is currently work in progress. I started a central debian directory to 
give packaging of osm a start. So everyone is invited to add/correct the stuff in here.
The Idea is to have different packages for the different subparts of osm.
Which all depend from the main Package OpenStreetMap.

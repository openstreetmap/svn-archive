Completly modeless? :

JOSM has 4 modes:
A. Zoom
B. Select (drag-move, shift=add, ctrl=remove, questionable rotate)
C. Add node (Shift=no-connect, Alt=new way, Ctrl=don't reuse node)
D. Delete (delete all, way only, all refering, delete way segment)

User actions necessary to cover:
1. Zoom
2. Select, Select group, add to selection
3. Move node/way/selection
4. Add node (alone, extend way, extend as new, reuse node)
5. Delete (node from way, way)


UI mapping:
* 1. Zoom - mouse wheel only (with ',' and '.' keys as zoom in/out at cursor)
* 2. Select:
*   Click on node/way - replace select
*   Shift-Drag - area select (both included and crossed)
*   Ctrl-click - toggle presence in selection
* 3a. Move node:
*   Drag with initial click on node
* 3b. Move way:
*   Drag with initial click on a way
* 3c. Move selection:
*   Drag with initial click on any selection member
*  4a. Create lone node:
*    Alt-click with empty selection on free space
* 4b. Extend way:
*   Alt-click on free space or way (injects node into way) with current
*   way selected.
*  4c. Extend as new way:
*    Click on node to select it, then as 4b
* 4d. extend way with node reuse:
*   Alt-click on existing node
  5.  Deletion handled as action, not mode:
    Select objects to delete, invoke the action


*) The rules (of least surprise salted with a grain of heurics) are:
 - trying to extend the way by a node that is currently the last one
   does nothing (allows drag)
 - trying to extend the way by a node that is next-to-the-last does nothing
   but reverts the last-used-node to the originally last node

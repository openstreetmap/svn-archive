This is a readme.txt to the Java OpenStreetMap Editor


Install Notes
-------------

To run JOSM, you need:

* The jar file (e.g. josm.jar)
* The latest Java Runtime Environment 1.5. 


How to get Java
---------------

You need at least Version 1.5 (called Java5 or "Tiger"). 

Microsoft Windows people should just visit java.sun.com and
download the latest Java5 executable. 

To get Java under linux, I recommend downloading the environment 
directly from Sun at http://java.sun.com. There is a linux 
binary installer which you have to execute from a console.

However, if you run Debian or Ubuntu or any other dpkg-based
distribution, you may use unofficial precompiled packages.
You have to add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list
(replace "stable" with your installation)

deb http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian/ stable non-free

The package is called sun-j2se5.0-jre-binary.

For MacOS user: There is an installer for Mac OS X 10.4:
http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html

Sorry, there is no Version of Java5 for Mac OS X 10.3 available :-(


How to launch
-------------

Microsoft Windows people launch by double clicking on the jar file.
If this does not help, open a command shell and type 
"java -jar josm-latest.jar" in the directory that holds the file.
(Please replace josm-latest.jar with the name of your jar file, if
you don't used the latest version.)

Under Linux open a shell, go to the file directory and type
"java -jar josm-latest.jar" to launch. If this don't help, try to set
you JAVA_HOME variable to the java location (the root location, not
the bin. "/usr/lib/sun-j2se5.0-jdk" if you used the prebuild 
package).

MacOS people just click on the jar-file.


How to get the Source
---------------------

Download it directly from the subversion at 
http://www.eigenheimstrasse.de/svn/josm. To use the command line
subverion client, type

svn co http://www.eigenheimstrasse.de/svn/josm


And gimme feedback: josm@eigenheimstrasse.de (start your mail subject 
with "JOSM", so my spam filter will not eat you)


Ciao, Imi.

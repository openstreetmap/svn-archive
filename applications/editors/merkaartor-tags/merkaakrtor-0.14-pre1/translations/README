Merkaartor stores translations in the .ts files from Qt and the .mat files of
templates. Translations can be done using linguist and hand written XML directly
in SVN or using Launchpad (preferred way) at
https://translations.launchpad.net/merkaartor/trunk

The script in this directory allows to convert between the two XML file types
and the standard gettext .po files.

The templates and the main translations are separated in two different sets
(name templates and merkaartor). These two should not be mixed.

Synchronisation may be like following:
  - Update whole merkaartor svn using "svn update" in root directory
  - Remove old stuff: make clean
  - Download po-files from Launchpad and store them in this directory
  - Call conversion: make
  - Checkin modified templates (in ../Templates) and .ts files
  - Upload changed .po and .pot files to launchpad

Conflict solving:
  - When no translations have been changed in SVN, then "all p(o)" may be
    choosen
  - When local changes have been done, conflicts should be solved one-by-one
  - "all up(s)tream" should only be choosen when you synchonised data directly
    before you started to make local translations.

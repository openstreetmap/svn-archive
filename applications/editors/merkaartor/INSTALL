Need
* Working C++ compiler
* Qt 4.2 or later development environment

On (K)ubuntu Edgy it is sufficient to install the qt4-dev package
to satisfy these requirements.

Instructions

1. Change directory to the one in which you unpacked Merkaartor

for example
$ cd /home/me/src/Merkaartor-0.xx

2. Run qmake

$ qmake

On (K)ubuntu this will probably pick up the qmake from Qt3 so
you need to explicitly run the correct one : /usr/share/qt4/bin/qmake

3. Run your build tool, make for posix like systems, nmake for
Windows C++ Build system

$ make
or
$ nmake

4. If you are lucky, you'll find an executable in the
release subdirectory. Otherwise mail a complete error log to
bvh-osm@irule.be

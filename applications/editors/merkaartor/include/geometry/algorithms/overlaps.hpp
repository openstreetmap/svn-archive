/*!
\defgroup overlap overlap detection
\par Source descriptions:
- Egenhofer: Two objects overlap if they have common interior faces and the bounding faces have common parts
with the opposite interior faces.

\note Implemented in scratch the Generic Geometry library. Will be reworked internally to support more geometries
but function call will stay as it is now.
\see http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTDOC/02+Geometry+Relationships#02GeometryRelationships-Overlaps
	where is stated that "inside" is not an "overlap", this is probably true and should then be implemented as such.

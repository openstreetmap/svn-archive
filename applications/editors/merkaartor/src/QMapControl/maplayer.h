/*!
 * There are two different layer types:
 *  - MapLayer: Displays Maps, but also Geometries. The configuration for displaying maps have to be done in the MapAdapter
 *  - GeometryLayer: Only displays Geometry objects.
 * 
 * MapLayers also can display Geometry objects. The difference to the GeometryLayer is the repainting. Objects that are
 * added to a MapLayer are "baken" on the map. This means, when you change it´s position for example the changes are
 * not visible until a new offscreen image has been drawn. If you have "static" Geometries which won´t change their
 * position this is fine. But if you want to change the objects position or pen you should use a GeometryLayer. Those
 * are repainted immediately on changes.

Changes since rev 633/Windows 161005 version
============================================

Sorted problem with off screen points (triedOffScrn) which caused strange
lines to be drawn when a track disappeared off the visible screen area.

Improved Landsat to use tiles; somewhat quicker now as it only downloads the
changed area. Really need to do some sort of caching, but not that
straightforward due to the floating point nature of latitude and longitude.

Removed the zero-length-trackseg bug.

When data is read from GPS, GPX file or GPX server, map is centred on the
read-in data.

OpenStreetMap Editor
====================

Current version: osmeditor2. Build with "make osmeditor2".

IMPORTANT
=========

If you get a linker error 'cannot find -lqt' change the following line:

QTLIB = -lqt

to

QTLIB = -lqt-mt

===============================================================================
Notes:
- Requires Qt3 and cURL to compile. 
- There are some real GPX files to play with. Look at the lats and longs
therein and start osmeditor2 with the appropriate options.
- Instructions on the OSM wiki. 


Loading SRTM height data
------------------------

If the NASA height files are present in a subdirectory (of the data
you run the executable from) called "data", osmeditor will now draw
contours for your current position.

NASA height files can be obtained from

  ftp://e0mss21u.ecs.nasa.gov/srtm/Eurasia/

e.g. N51W001.hgt is the square with SW corner 51N, 1W.

Building
--------

To build on Debian/sarge, one need to install the following dependencies:

  libqt3-dev libcurl3-dev

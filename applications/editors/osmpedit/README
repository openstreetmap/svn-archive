The following Perl modules are needed for osmpedit:

    WWW::Curl::easy
    XML::TokeParser
    Tk
    Tk::JPEG
    Image::Size
    Getopt::Mixed

In Debian unstable I had to install Tk::JPEG and XML::TokeParser using
CPAN.  In stable I think I also had to install XML::TokeParser this
way.  Tk::JPEG seems to install a new Tk also.

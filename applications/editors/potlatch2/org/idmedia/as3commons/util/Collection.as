  /**
   * The root interface in the <i>collection hierarchy</i>.  A collection
   * represents a group of objects, known as its <i>elements</i>.  Some
   * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not.  Some are ordered
   * and others unordered.  The JDK does not provide any <i>direct</i>
   * implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
   * specific subinterfaces like <tt>Set</tt> and <tt>List</tt>.  This interface
   * is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
   * maximum generality is desired.
   *
   * <p><i>Bags</i> or <i>multisets</i> (unordered collections that may contain
   * duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.
   *
   * <p>The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
   * methods that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to
   * throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if this collection does not
   * support the operation.  If this is the case, these methods may, but are not
   * required to, throw an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the
   * invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For example, invoking
   * the #addAll(Collection) method on an unmodifiable collection may,
   * but is not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added
   * is empty.
   *
   * <p>Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that
   * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
   * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
   * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
   * <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
   * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
   * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
   * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
   * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
   * the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an
   * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
   * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
   * interface.

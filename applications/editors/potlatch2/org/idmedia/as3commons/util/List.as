  /**
   * An ordered collection (also known as a <i>sequence</i>).  The user of this
   * interface has precise control over where in the list each element is
   * inserted.  The user can access elements by their integer index (position in
   * the list), and search for elements in the list.<p>
   *
   * Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements.  More formally,
   * lists typically allow pairs of elements <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt>
   * such that <tt>e1.equals(e2)</tt>, and they typically allow multiple
   * null elements if they allow null elements at all.  It is not inconceivable
   * that someone might wish to implement a list that prohibits duplicates, by
   * throwing runtime exceptions when the user attempts to insert them, but we
   * expect this usage to be rare.<p>
   *
   * The <tt>List</tt> interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
   * specified in the <tt>Collection</tt> interface, on the contracts of the
   * <tt>iterator</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>
   * methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
   * also included here for convenience.<p>
   *
   * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides four methods for positional (indexed)
   * access to list elements.  Lists (like arrays) are zero based.  Note
   * that these operations may execute in time proportional to the index value
   * for some implementations (the <tt>LinkedList</tt> class, for
   * example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically
   * preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the
   * implementation.<p>
   *
   * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides a special iterator, called a
   * <tt>ListIterator</tt>, that allows element insertion and replacement, and
   * bidirectional access in addition to the normal operations that the
   * <tt>Iterator</tt> interface provides.  A method is provided to obtain a
   * list iterator that starts at a specified position in the list.<p>
   *
   * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to search for a specified
   * object. From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with
   * caution. In many implementations they will perform costly linear
   * searches.<p>
   *
   * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to efficiently insert and
   * remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list.<p>
   *
   * <p>Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that
   * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
   * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
   * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
   * <tt>NullPointerException</tt>.  Attempting
   * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
   * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
   * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
   * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
   * the insertion of an ineligible element into the list may throw an
   * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
   * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
   * interface.

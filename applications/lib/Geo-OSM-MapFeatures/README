Geo::OSM::MapFeatures -- Parses and represents OpenStreetMap Map Features

OpenStreetMap does not have any content restrictions on tags that can
be assigned to Nodes, Ways or Areas. You can use any tags you
like. However, there is benefit in agreeing a recommended set of
features and corresponding tags in order to create, interpret and
display a common basemap. Map Features contains a core recommended
feature set and corresponding tags.

This module downloads and parses map features and tries to make it
easy access for software, something the original wiki page is most
certainly not.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

EXAMPLE

use Geo::OSM::MapFeatures;

my $mf = new Geo::OSM::MapFeatures;
$mf->download();
$mf->parse();

# To print a simple ascii representation:
foreach my $category ( $mf->categories() ){
    print "\n\n===== $category =====\n";
    foreach my $feature ( $mf->features($category) ){
        print "$feature\n";
    }
}

# Or you can choose not to use the string overloading and get the
# individual elements yourself:
foreach my $category ( $mf->categories() ){
    print "\n\n===== $category =====\n";
    foreach my $feature ( $mf->features($category) ){
        print "Key: ".$feature->key()."\n";
        print "Value(s): ". join("\n          ", @{$feature->values()})."\n";
        print "Description: ".$feature->description()."\n\n";
    }
}

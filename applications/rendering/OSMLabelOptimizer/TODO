TODO:

*  Optimize area feature labels
   o Find the area in the svg file where the label belongs to
   o Find a set of possible positions for the label 
* Create a preprocessor for splitting and reversing streets if otherwise labels would be printed upside down
* Try to avoid having parts of labels cut off at the edge
* Line wrap for point feature and area feature labels (thanks to Frederik Ramm for this idea)

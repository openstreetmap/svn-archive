Usage information
-----------------

Fetch planet file from OpenStreetmap and feed it to gosmore

The rebuild process uses a lot of memory and free disk space for osm files
with a compressed size greater than a few mega bytes. Rebuilding the
complete planet take around 3 hours on a dual core 64 bit machine with 2 GB
of RAM and 20 GB of free disk space.

Gosmore
=======

Gosmore is a viewer of the OpenStreetmap.org XML data such as the
planet.

The project home page is at
<URL:http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Gosmore>

Usage information
-----------------

Fetch planet file from OpenStreetmap and feed it to gosmore

  bzcat planet-...osm.bz2 | gosmore rebuild

The rebuild process uses a lot of memory.  Around 2007-08-05, more than
1 GiB of RAM is needed.  This is due to the design of the program and the
size of the OpenStreetmap.org data set.

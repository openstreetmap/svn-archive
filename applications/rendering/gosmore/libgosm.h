/* This struct takes up a lot of space, but compressing is possible: If
other is encoded as byte offset from the current position, it should typically
be close to 0. So it can be Huffman encoded. Then the struct will no longer
have a fixed size, and the final position of an nd will not be known during
the first pass. So we over estimate the space needed between 2 nds and we can
do multiple passes until all the excess has been removed.

The difference between lat and wayPtr->clat will normally also be quite
small and can also be Huffman coded. The same applies to lon.

C code can be generated for these non dynamic Huffman decoders and the C
compiler can then optimize it for efficient decompression. Not only will this
save (flash) storage, but it will also increase the size of maps that can be
loaded and reduce the paging that is so slow on mobile devices.

The scripts in this directory together form the "history service"
as operated on http://openstreetmap.gryph.de/history/.

All are written by Frederik Ramm <frederik@remote.org> and released
into the Public Domain.

The scripts are not really designed to be operated by others and
thus some things are not well documented and some assumptions are
hard-coded but I'll give a quick overview:

* You need a MySQL database holding your data. The bulk of data
  will reside in the "nodes" table, basically having the lat/lon
  of every node plus information about the planet file where the
  node first appeared and where it was last seen (in case it has
  been deleted). Another table simply lists the planet files that
  have been imported, and one keeps track of user requests (jobs).
  The create table statement for the job table is at the end of 
  this readme.

  That database is assumed to be named "osmhistory" and accessible
  without password.

  The program uses integer values for dates (2007-10-05 becoming
  71005) and for lat/lon values (multiplying them by 10,000).

* The "import.pl" script takes a planet file on stdin and updates
  the "nodes" and "planet" tables. It creates these if they do not
  exist. It updates existing "node" records (extending their life
  time so to speak) or inserts new records. It is important that
  planet files are imported in a strict chronological order.
  Give the date for the planet file on the command line, e.g. 
  71005 if you're importing planet-071005.osm.

* The "index.cgi" script displays existing jobs and accepts new
  jobs into the queue. It is really just a simple CGI, working with
  the "jobs" table exclusively.

* The "hqrun.pl" script is the queue runner. It reads jobs from the
  queue and creates the animated gif images. It requires the Proj
  and GD modules, plus the external application "gifsicle" for 
  creating the animations. hqrun.pl makes some assumptions about
  the image destination paths; adjust these.

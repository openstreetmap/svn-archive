This directory contains or/p, a Perl implementation of the popular
Osmarender renderer. or/p is designed to be a drop-in replacement
for the XSLT version of Osmarender, i.e. it processes the same rule
files and the same data and emits the same output.

Usage:

perl orp.pl -r rulefile.xml datafile.osm

will create "datafile.svg".

Further comments in orp.pl.

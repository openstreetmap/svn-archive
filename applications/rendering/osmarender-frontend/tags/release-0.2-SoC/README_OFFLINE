OFFLINE VERSION
=====

To use Osmarender Frontend's offline version, you need to tweak Firefox 3 configuration
in order to let the frontend load local files for i18n.

In Firefox 3's location bar, you need to write "about:config". Then search for the following
key:

fileuri.strict_origin_policy

and set it to FALSE

This is a well known issue with dojotoolkit and Firefox 3, as you can see in:

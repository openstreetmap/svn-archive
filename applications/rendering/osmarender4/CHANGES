                <bounds> element in rules file allows bounding box of map to be specified
                <bounds> element in .osm file allows bounding box of map to be specified
                Improved rules file, lots of new tags, icons and cleaner look and feel
                Rules file does not select segments for rendering by default (this encourages everyone to tag ways) 
                Tested with IE 6.x, Firefox 1.5, xalan, xmlstarlet, xsltproc, Adobe ASV3, Inkscape, Batik-Squiggle
3.1 2006-09-30  Implements waysegment pseudo-element to enable segments that are part of a way to be selected
                Grid lines are now generated properly
                Rendering of external white border is now improved when bounds are specified
                No external white border when no bounds specified
                Various tweaks to the rules file
3.2 2006-12-29  Added svg namespace to marker elements (Joto)
                Added rendering for place=suburb (same as place=village) (Joto)
                Added optional "osmfile" parameter to XSL stylesheet which can be used to override default filename for OSM data file (Joto)
                Changed rendering order of motorway|trunk|primary[_link] (Joto)
                Added icon for amenity=post_box (currently same as post_office) (Joto)
                Now draws name for highway=track if available (Joto)
                Added call to copyAttributes template to a use element for ways, dashed railway lines and steps now work properly (Joto)
                highway=gate was rendered way to large. Icon simplified and made smaller (Joto)

4.0 2007-01-06  Split up osmarender.xsl into many smaller files which are easier to handle for developers
                Changes list is now in this file, rules doc now in README
                New makefile to pull those smaller files together again for easier usage by users
                Pulled out call to rendering rules into new processRules template which takes a boolean parameter withOSMLayers
                Got rid of xsl:attribute's in favour of {} in scale drawing code
                Added osmarender shell wrapper
                Interactive javascript stuff (zoom/pan control) will only be added if /rules/@interactive="yes", default is "no"
                Optional map title added
                Draw scale and attribution/copyright outside map area
                Draw Creative Commons copyright logo as SVG instead of included PNG, removed OpenStreetMap logo
                Added meta data and copyright info in DublinCore/RDF format (can be retrieved automatically, for instance in Inkscape)
                Deletes e=area from rule file, because they don't exist (use ways instead)
                Replaced makeshift bounding box by SVG clipping (but this does not work in Firefox!)
                Added groupings, ids and inkscape layers to some SVG elements like borders, grids, the map itself, etc. Allows enabling and disabling parts of SVG file
                Added <layer/> element for rules file to create SVG layers with part of the data. <layer/> has optional "display" and "opacity" attributes.
                Put all feature in standard styles into several SVG layers
                Added <addclass/> element for rules file. (See README)
                Mini roundabouts (nodes) are drawn
                Bridges and tunnels sort of work now. Bridges works reasonably well, tunnels definitely need some more work
                Patch from Johann Gail to draw street names right side up included. Use osmarender:nameDirection=-1 to write in other direction than the automatically chosen one.
                Bugfix: If a way path was turned around for the street name to show correctly the oneway direction was also changed.
                This version needs some EXSLT extensions, this could break osmarender in some XSL transformators that don't support this. Tested with xsltproc, xmlstarlet and XALAN Java, the C version of XALAN does not work.
    2007-01-16  Added rendering for railway=halt. (Joto)
    2007-01-17  Fixed bug where text on segment wasn't rendered. (Joto)
4.1 2007-01-23  Improved tunnel rendering (Joto)
                Bugfix: When all meta data is suppressed the empty white background box is also suppressed
    2007-02-04  Bugfix for drawing areas with holes (80n)
    2007-02-05  Added rendering for natural=forest|wood to standard rule (Joto)
    2007-02-06  Added option withUntaggedSegments="yes" to rule file. If this is set all segments belonging to no way and without any tags (except "created_by") are rendered as dotted faint grey lines. (Joto)
                Changed "meta" to "marginalia" in many places better describing what it is. (Joto)
                New svgBaseProfile attribute on <rules/> element allows setting to "full", "tiny", or "basic" for different SVG profiles. This is preliminary support for Mobile SVG. (Joto)
                Standardised indents in all files (Joto)
                Fixed long standing bug where street names were rendered too far up in inkscape (this was because inscape doesn't support baseline-shift). Used dy attribute on tspan element instead of baseline-shift (Joto)
                Added rendering of aerialway (Joto)
                Changed font to free font "DejaVu Sans" with fallback to sans-serif (Joto)
                Changed width/height/viewBox of master <svg/> to do the right thing in all cases (depending on marginalia shown etc.) (Joto)
                Removed debugging output in osmarender bin (Joto)
    2007-02-13  Changed the symbol handling. There is now a new subdirectory "symbols" which contains all the symbols. From these files the symbols.svg is created, which gets included into map SVG files. See [[Osmarender/Symbols]] in the wiki for details. (Joto)
                Somewhat simplified SVG code for text along path. (Joto)
    2007-02-15  Removed @dy attribute from text element in src/draw.xsl and added it to all <text> elements in the rules file. (Joto)
                Symbols in catalogue now sorted alphabetically. (Joto)
    2007-03-19  Support for frolloized osm files.  Will use the hints provided to draw street names and areas better. (80n)
                Missing symbolScale attribute added to standard.xml. (80n)
    2007-03-30  Reverted fix from 80n in draw.xsl as it breaks symbol rendering (Joto)

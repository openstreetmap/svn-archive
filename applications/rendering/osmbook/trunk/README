* About

"osmbook" is a application that wraps around a number of other OSM
tools to produce a "map book".  A map region is gridded into
sub-squares and the entire area is printed one grid square at a time
onto a page.  A first page is printed with a preliminary high-level
map containing a grid-overlay for quick page-number look-up.

OSMPS - a PostScript renderer for OpenStreetMap files
=====================================================

OSMPS generates Encapsulated PostScript files from OSM XML files.
Rules for generating parts of the output are currently contained
within the program and describe PostScript code to be utilised for
particular tags.

PostScript is sent to standard output. Typical usage would be

  osmps.rb map.osm > map.ps

as a subsequent step a PDF file may be generated with the common
ps2pdf tool (which is a wrapper around GhostScript), or with Adobe
Distiller.

  ps2pdf map.ps

Internal data structure
-----------------------

OSMPS possibly uses an odd method of processing the data. First
nodes and segments are read from the file. Ways are then read but
the tags are purely "pushed down" onto the segments that are in
each way. Finally, paths are created from adjacent segments that
are (a) pointing in the same direction and (b) have exactly the
same tag set.

Features
--------

Current features include basic areas, roads, simple bridges and
road names. Planned next are oneway arrows and nodes such as
churches and fuel stations, possibly followed by little dots that
can tell you where people are. But don't count on it.

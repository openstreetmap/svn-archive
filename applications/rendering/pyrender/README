pyrender
========

pyrender retrieves OpenStreetMap data and renders them to png tiles on demand. I also provides a simple web server with a "slippy map" that is used to display the tiles, providing a map similar to Google Maps.

It is written in python and provides a plug-in mechanism for different render backends. Currently PIL (Python imaging library) and Cairo (cairographics.org) are supported, Cairo is used as the default backend.

USAGE
-----
run "python server.py" and open a browser window pointing to "http://localhost:1280". Downloaded data will be stored in the "cache" subdirectory.

WHY pyrender?
-------------
pyrender caches the retrieved .osm data, meaning that it will retrieve only missing data, making it suitable for offline usage. It's on the fly rendering enables to apply different stylesheets, even after the data has been downloaded.

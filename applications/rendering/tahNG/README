== What this is about == 

Maintainer: Dirk-Lueder Kreie (Deelkar)

Purpose: Rendering maps with osmarender for the slippy map osmarender 
         layer from live OSM data.

On the Wiki: [[Tiles@home/nextgen]]


== Getting Started == 

Copy the config template related to your OS to tahng.conf,
then edit to set you username and password for tiles upload in authentication.conf

== Running the client ==

To start generating tiles from the server queue, run "ngcore.pl loop".
CAUTION: if your country uses a comma for decimal separator (like Germany) 
you need to set your decimal separator to "." instead on windows.
On linux and other unix-like systems this can be accomplished by setting 
i18n=1 in your tilesathome.conf .
If you don't do this inkscape will complain and generate empty tiles. 

If you want to render a specific tile run ngcore.pl with the xy option
for example if you want to render the tile number x=2148 y=1332 
(zoom 12 is the default and should not be changed) you would run
./ngcore.pl xy 2148 1332 12

To upload tiles use "ngcore.pl upload" (this is called automatically 
in loop mode).


== Stopping the client ==

The client will stop automatically after completing its job, unless in "loop"
mode. 
Loop mode can be exited cleanly simply by creating a file called "stopfile.txt" 
in the tilesAtHome directory. Upon encountering this file the client will exit
after it completes it's current job.


== Troubleshooting ==

# Set the timeout when downloading files (on tenths of a second)

# APIServers and XAPIServers define the servers to use to download OSM datta from.
# APIServers are used for standard map downloads and XAPIServers are used for downloads 
# with the specification of predicates.
# The actual download URLs need to be defined by API_<NAME> and XAPI_<NAME> settings.
# Currently defined servers are API, ROMA and XAPI for APIServers and XAPI for XAPIServers.
#APIServers = API,ROMA,XAPI
#XAPIServers = XAPI

# Hand back render requests that have a tileset on a server bigger than
# MaxTilesetComplexity. Useful if you do not have much RAM and inkscape
# crashes. The biggest tileset is about 31000000, so playing with values
# around 20000000 will help you. A setting of 0 disables the mechanism.
MaxTilesetComplexity = 0

# Machines with relatively small memory can encounter problems when rendering
# complex tilesets.  If Inkscape fails with error messages on high zoom levels
# indicating a memory issue, try to set RenderStripes to a positive value
# The value of RenderStripes is determining from which zoom level below the
# highest on the SVG file will be rendered in stripes.  E.g. a value of 5 means 
# that the 5th zoom level below the top level (normally 12) is to be rendered in
# stripes.  This would be z17 on a standard tileset.  A value of 5 should be
# sufficient in most cases.  Reducing that value increases the number of Inkscape
# calls.  A value of 0 disables striped rendering.  This is the default.
#RenderStripes = 0


## Upload settings

# if set to 0 the zip files will get renamed to zip_uploaded after upload.
DeleteZipFilesAfterUpload=1

# set UploadToDirectory to 1 to enable uploading to a common upload 
# directory from which one central client can handle all the uploading
UploadToDirectory=0

# Recommended setting 1/2 your kbyte/s upstream of your uploader to the tah server
# Recommended maximum setting: 1.5 times your kbyte/s upstream of your uploader

# If set to 1, make a copy of the data file for later debugging purposes
KeepDataFile=0

# What rasterizer to use.
# Set to Inkscape, Batik or BatikAgent
Rasterizer=Inkscape

# Set the maximum heap size for the java virtual machine. Use 'M' for megabytes, 'G' for gigabytes.
# If nothing is specified then a default of 512M is used. Do not specify more RAM than your machine has.
# Note1: In the future this setting will be used for all calls to java
# Note2: on Windows 64bit/32bit dual installations the VM used is determined by system32\java.exe
#        If it selects the 32bit one, the maximum heap is limited.
#JavaHeapSize=1350M

# Set to the maximum JVM size to pass to the -Xmx parameter when running the rasterizer. The
# maximum size depends on the OS. For Windows XP it is 1350M
BatikJVMSize=1350M

# If set to 1 or greater, it will enable forking to render several zoom levels to SVG simultanously
# Fork = n  -> use 2*n parallel processes for rendering to svg
Fork=0

# make the client upload in the background if set to 1
ForkForUpload=0

# Maxdepth for xmlstarlet, reduce if you run into problems with memory,
# increase if you get "tile too complex" errors.

# Set this to 1 if you want to clear the stopfile.txt on program start. 
# may unintentionally clear stopfile.txt when (accidentally) running 2 instances

## Verbosity: changing this makes the client report different actions more or
## less verbosely.
#
# Verbose=0  almost like "quiet" on other programs, just output wether it's 
#            getting a request, preprocessing, rendering or uploading, no 
#            progress inside a tileset (%ages) or on uploading zips.
# Verbose=3  show progress inside a tileset and on upload, but not the single
#            steps while rendering
# Verbose=6  show everything like it was before r9700, this is the default
# Verbose=10 behaves like Verbose=1 before r9700, adding a newline after 
#            each message, and printing even more output.
Verbose=6

# DateTimeString allows you to prepend client log messages with a time stamp. Default off.
# %H - hours
# %M - minutes
# %S - seconds
# %d - days
# %m - months
# %y - 2-digit year
# %Y - 4-digit year
#DateTimeString = %d.%m.%Y - %H:%M:%S

# Layer configuration for tiles@home
# ================================== 
#
# You can add any number of layers here. Whenever a tile is rendered, 
# tiles for all layers will be generated and uploaded to the server.
# Make sure not to create and upload layers that the server doesn't
# want - that would be a waste of resources.

# All settings here can be overwritten on command-line, but should not.


# Master list of layers
# ---------------------
# 
# Layers defines a list of layers to be rendered in XY mode
# Either run default (highzoom) or lowzoom, not both at the same time
# Lowzoom (<z12) works in xy mode, but not yet in loop mode!
# could be overridden on command line as "--Layers=caption" for example
Layers = captionless,tile,maplint

# LowzoomLayers defines a list of layers to be rendered in XY mode 
# for zoom levels <12 and >= 6 if not specified on the command line.
LowzoomLayers = caption,captionless,tile

# WorldLayers defines a list of layers to be rendered in XY mode 
# for zoom levels <6 if not specified on the command line.
WorldLayers = captionless,tile

# LayersCapability will enable the client to switch automatically between 
# lowzoom and default/maplint Layers depending on job from t@h server
LayersCapability = captionless,tile,maplint,caption

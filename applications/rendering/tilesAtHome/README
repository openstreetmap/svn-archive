Purpose: Rendering maps with osmarender for the slippy map osmarender 
         layer, from live OSM data.

On the Wiki: [[Tiles@home]]


== Getting Started == 

To use this copy the config template related to your OS to tilesAtHome.conf,
then edit to set your preferred config options
the username and password for tiles upload you can set in the file 
authentication.conf, for which a template also exists.


== Running the client ==

To start generating tiles from the server queue, run "tilesGen.pl loop".

If you want to render a specific tile run tilesGen.pl with the xy option
for example if you want to render the tile number x=2148 y=1332 
(zoom 12 is always the default and cannot be changed) you would run
./tilesGen.pl xy 2148 1332

To upload tiles use "tilesGen.pl upload" (this is only called automatically 
in loop mode).


== Stopping the client ==

The client will stop automatically after completing its job, unless in "loop"
mode. Loop mode can be exited cleanly simply by creating a file called 
"stopfile.txt" in the tilesAtHome directory. Upon encountering this file the
client will exit after it completes it's current job.

Running "tilesGen.pl stop" will do this for you.


== Troubleshooting ==

Have a look at the OSM wiki:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Tiles%40home/Install_Guide

And follow the "tilesathome" mailing list.

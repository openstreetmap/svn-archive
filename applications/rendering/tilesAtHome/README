== What this is about == 

Maintainer: Oliver J White (OJW) / Dirk-Lueder Kreie (Deelkar)

Purpose: Rendering maps with osmarender for the slippy map osmarender 
         layer from live OSM data.

On the Wiki: [[Tiles@home]]


== Getting Started == 

To use this copy the config template related to your OS to tilesAtHome.conf,
then edit to set you username and password for tiles upload


== Running the client ==

To start generating tiles from the server queue, run "tilesGen.pl loop".
CAUTION: if your country uses a comma for decimal separator (like Germany) 
you need to set your decimal separator to "." instead. 
If you don't do this inkscape will complain and generate empty tiles. 
On linux and other unix-like systems this can be accomplished by setting 
i18n=1 in your tilesathome.conf .

If you want to render a specific tile run tilesGen.pl with the xy option
for example if you want to render the tile number x=2148 y=1332 
(zoom 12 is always the default and cannot be changed) you would run
./tilesGen.pl xy 2148 1332

To upload tiles use "tilesGen.pl upload" (this is called automatically 
in loop mode).


== Stopping the client ==

The client will stop automatically after completing its job, unless in "loop"
mode. Loop mode can be exited cleanly simply by creating a file called 
"stopfile.txt" in the tilesAtHome directory. Upon encountering this file the
client will exit after it completes it's current job.


== Troubleshooting ==

Have a look at the OSM wiki:

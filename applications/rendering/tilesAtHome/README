== What this is about == 

Maintainer: Oliver J White (OJW) / Dirk-Lueder Kreie (Deelkar)

Purpose: Rendering maps with osmarender for the slippy map osmarender 
         layer from live OSM data.

On the Wiki: [[Tiles@home]]


== Getting Started == 

To use this copy the correct config template to tilesAtHome.conf then edit
to set you username and password (both for osm data and for tiles upload)


== Running the client ==

to start generating tiles run "tilesGen.pl" CAUTION: if your country uses 
a comma for decimal separator (like Germany) you need to set LANG=C 
beforehand on unix-like systems. If you don't do this inkscape will complain 
and generate empty tiles.
if you want to render a specific tile run tilesGen.pl with the xy option
for example if you want to render the tile number x=2148 y=1332 
(zoom 12 is always the default and cannot be changed) you would run
./tilesGen.pl xy 2148 1332

to upload tiles use "upload.pl"

(might need multiple calls to upload everything, depending on your setup)


== Stopping the client ==

the client will stop automatically after completing its job, unless in "loop"
mode. This can be exited cleanly simply by creating a file called 
"stopfile.txt" in the tilesAtHome directory. Upon encountering this file the
client will exit after it completes it's current job.


== Troubleshooting ==

Have a look at the OSM wiki:

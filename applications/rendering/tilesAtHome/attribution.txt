# tiles@home attribution file.
#
# This file provides a mapping from OSM screen name to a free attribution text
# you want to show up on zoom level 17 on the t@h maps.
#
# The default attribution, if you do not override it in this file, is a copyright
# sign followed by your screen name.
#
# Please do not change attribution for other users unless you have been specifically
# asked to do so!
#
# EXAMPLES
# --------
#
# If you do not want your name listed, just but your screen name followed by an
# equal sign:
# myname=
#
# If you want your name listed without a (c) symbol, use
# myname=myname
#
# If you want something different,
# myname=something different
#
# Remember the (c) symbol has to be written as &#169; 
# Note "#" only starts a comment when placed in the first column.

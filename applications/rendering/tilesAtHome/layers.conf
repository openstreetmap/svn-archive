# Layer configuration for tiles@home
# ================================== 
#
# You can add any number of layers here. Whenever a tile is rendered, 
# tiles for all layers will be generated and uploaded to the server.
# Make sure not to create and upload layers that the server doesn't
# want - that would be a waste of resources.

# The names here are really just symbols, you could use anything you
# want.

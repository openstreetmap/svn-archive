## If you want to use 7Zip set this to 1 and set "Zip" above to your 7zip.exe

## Upload settings
# UploadChunkSize is the maximum Zip size in MiB (1024^2 byte) for non-tileset uploads
UploadChunkSize=9   # Megabyte, hard limit 9.5 MiB (10 MB)

# UploadChunkCount is the maximum count of png files compressed in one zip
# 	if you don't suffer from posix command line limits, you can increase 
# 	this limit to arbitrary sizes. (keep in mind that some FS cannot 
# 	support more than a couple thousand files in a directory.
UploadChunkCount=13650  # default: 10 tilesets (will never be reached in practise)

# if set to 0 the zip files will get renamed to zip_uploaded after upload.
DeleteZipFilesAfterUpload=0

#Upload layers when they are done? default: 0
# set to 1, if you want to upload layers as they are done, instead of waiting for all
# layers in the tileset to be rendered.
LayerUpload=0

#if a set is empty and RenderFullTileset = 0 only one tile is created
# set to 1 if the tile should be stored in workdir, so you can upload a bunch of them
# if set to 0 this tile will be uploaded as a set
GatherBlankTiles=0

# If set to 1, then Batik will be used for rendering instead of Inkscape
Batik=0

# Set to the maximum JVM size to pass to the -Xmx parameter when running the rasterizer. The
# maximum size depends on the OS. For Windows XP it is 1350M
BatikJVMSize=1350M

# Set to the location of the batik rasterizer jar. The Batik libraries should reside in the same folder,
#   or in a sub-folder named lib
BatikPath=c:\tilesAtHome\batik\batik-rasterizer.jar

# If set to 1 or greater, it will enable forking to render tiles, might not work for windows, currently.

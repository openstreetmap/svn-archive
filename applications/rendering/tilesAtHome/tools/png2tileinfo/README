README for png2tileinfo
-----------------------

This is the "source" for the oceantiles_12.dat file used in 
close-areas.pl and in lowzoom.pl.

The oceantiles_12.dat file contains two bytes for every level-12
tile in the world, specifying whether it is a land tile, a sea tile,
a coastal tile, or unknown.

The file is easy to access by the programs using it, but difficult
to edit. So here is the "source data" in the form of a large PNG
file 4096x4096 pixels for the whole planet, in which each pixel 
corresponds to one level-12 tile and may have one of four colours:

white - coastline intersects with this tile
green - no coastline intersect, land tile
blue -  no coastline intersect, sea tile
black - unknown

If you find errors in the data file - i.e. an inland area rendered 
blue or a sea area not rendered blue -, you can simply fix the PNG file
with any image editor, then run png2tileinfo, and you have a new
data file. (Please make sure to upload both the .png file that you
changed and the .dat file created!)

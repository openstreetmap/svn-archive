# APIServers and XAPIServers define the servers to use to download OSM datta from.
# APIServers are used for standard map downloads and XAPIServers are used for downloads 
# with the specification of predicates.
# The actual download URLs need to be defined by API_<NAME> and XAPI_<NAME> settings.
# Currently defined servers are API, ROMA and XAPI for APIServers and XAPI for XAPIServers.
#APIServers = API,ROMA,XAPI
#XAPIServers = XAPI

# Fall back to XAPI in case we get a "no data here" error.
# assumes XAPI is current enough for rendering, and can take the load
FallBackToXAPI = 0

# Hand back render requests that have a tileset on a server bigger than
# MaxTilesetComplexity. Useful if you do not have much RAM and inkscape
# crashes. The biggest tileset is about 31000000, so playing with values
# around 20000000 will help you. A setting of 0 disables the mechanism.
MaxTilesetComplexity = 0


## Upload settings

# if set to 0 the zip files will get renamed to zip_uploaded after upload.
DeleteZipFilesAfterUpload=1

# set UploadToDirectory to 1 to enable uploading to a common upload 
# directory from which one central client can handle all the uploading
UploadToDirectory=0
UploadTargetDirectory=/set/this/to/your/upload/directory

# Recommended setting 1/2 your kbyte/s upstream of your uploader to the tah server
# Recommended maximum setting: 1.5 times your kbyte/s upstream of your uploader

## Beziercurve hinting
NoBezier=0  # Set to 1 if beziercurvehinting causes errors.

#if a set is empty and RenderFullTileset = 0 only one tile is created
# set to 1 if the tile should be stored in workdir, so you can upload a bunch of them
# if set to 0 this tile will be uploaded as a set

# If set to 1, make a copy of the data file for later debugging purposes

# If set to 1, then Batik will be used for rendering instead of Inkscape
# If set to 2, then the Batik-wrapper will be used instead of Batik .jar file
# (adjust the path below accordingly)
# If set to 3, then Batik in agent mode will be used. The renderning is faster 
# than other modes or inkscape, but it require BatikClasspath to be set correctly
Batik=0

# Set to the location of the batik rasterizer jar or the Batik wrapper (see
# Batik config parameter above) The Batik libraries should reside in the same
# folder, or in a sub-folder named lib.
BatikPath=/usr/share/batik-1.6/lib/batik-rasterizer.jar

# Path to jars required by Batik in agent mode
#BatikClasspath=batik-rasterizer.jar:xercesImpl.jar:batik-agent.jar

# Set to the maximum JVM size to pass to the -Xmx parameter when running the
# rasterizer. The maximum size depends on the OS and the available memory.
# For 32bit Systems it is 1536M (1.5GiB)

# Maxdepth for xmlstarlet, reduce if you run into problems with memory,
# increase if you get "tile too complex" errors.

# This feature is experimental and currently linux only. Don't use if you are
# using inkscape with the same username outside tiles@home. 
# Set to 1 if you want to t@h to try and autobackup and -restore your inkscape
# preferences file
AutoResetInkscapePrefs=0

# Set this to 1 if you want to clear the stopfile.txt on program start. 
# may unintentionally clear stopfile.txt when (accidentally) running 2 instances

## Verbosity: changing this makes the client report different actions more or
## less verbosely.
#
# Verbose=0  almost like "quiet" on other programs, just output wether it's 
#            getting a request, preprocessing, rendering or uploading, no 
#            progress inside a tileset (%ages) or on uploading zips.
# Verbose=3  show progress inside a tileset and on upload, but not the single
#            steps while rendering
# Verbose=6  show everything like it was before r9700, this is the default
# Verbose=10 behaves like Verbose=1 before r9700, adding a newline after 
#            each message
Verbose=6

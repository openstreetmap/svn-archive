# APIServers and XAPIServers define the servers to use to download OSM datta from.
# APIServers are used for standard map downloads and XAPIServers are used for downloads 
# with the specification of predicates.
# The actual download URLs need to be defined by API_<NAME> and XAPI_<NAME> settings.
# Currently defined servers are API, ROMA and XAPI for APIServers and XAPI for XAPIServers.

# Hand back render requests that have a tileset on a server bigger than
# MaxTilesetComplexity. Useful if you do not have much RAM and inkscape
# crashes. The biggest tileset is about 31000000, so playing with values
# around 20000000 will help you. A setting of 0 disables the mechanism.

## Upload settings

# if set to 0 the zip files will get renamed to zip_uploaded after upload.

#if a set is empty and RenderFullTileset = 0 only one tile is created

# If set to 1, make a copy of the data file for later debugging purposes
KeepDataFile=0

# If set to 1, then Batik will be used for rendering instead of Inkscape
# If set to 3, then Batik in agent mode will be used. The renderning is faster 
# than other modes or inkscape, but it require BatikClasspath to be set correctly
Batik=0

# Set to the maximum JVM size to pass to the -Xmx parameter when running the rasterizer. The
# maximum size depends on the OS. For Windows XP it is 1350M

## Verbosity: changing this makes the client report different actions more or
## less verbosely.
#
# Verbose=0  almost like "quiet" on other programs, just output wether it's 
#            getting a request, preprocessing, rendering or uploading, no 
#            progress inside a tileset (%ages) or on uploading zips.
# Verbose=3  show progress inside a tileset and on upload, but not the single
#            steps while rendering
# Verbose=6  show everything like it was before r9700, this is the default
# Verbose=10 behaves like Verbose=1 before r9700, adding a newline after 
#            each message, and printing even more output.
Verbose=6

colormap.pl is a small script that tries to find all colors that are used in
a particular osmarender layer

SYNOPSIS

    tools/colormap/colormap.pl [-s|-w] <layer> [<layer> ...]

DESCRIPTION

    colormap.pl goes through all rules files that are defined in layers.conf
    for each layer supplied on the command line and finds all colors that are
    specified in their text/css sections as well as any embedded SVG elements.
    Then it goes through files that have been included in the rules files and
    looks for SVG elements in there.  At last it searches all SVG files that
    are in the osmarender/symbols directory.  It counts all occurences for
    each color and includes this in the output.

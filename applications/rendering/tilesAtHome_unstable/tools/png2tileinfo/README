README for png2tileinfo
-----------------------

This is the "source" for the oceantiles_12.dat file used in 
close-areas.pl and in lowzoom.pl.

The oceantiles_12.dat file contains two bits for every level-12
tile in the world, specifying whether it is a land tile, a sea tile,
a coastal tile, or unknown.

The file is easy to access by the programs using it, but difficult
to edit. So here is the "source data" in the form of a large PNG
file 4096x4096 pixels for the whole planet, in which each pixel 
corresponds to one level-12 tile and may have one of four colours:

white - coastline intersects with this tile
green - no coastline intersect, land tile
blue -  no coastline intersect, sea tile
black - unknown

If you find errors in the data file - i.e. an inland area rendered 
blue or a sea area not rendered blue -, you can simply fix the PNG file
with any image editor, then run png2tileinfo, and you have a new
data file. (Please make sure to upload both the .png file that you
changed and the .dat file created!)

Please note that the code is picky about the colours used. Nothing
but "pure" colors will do - blue has to be 0,0,255, green has to be
0,255,0, black is 0,0,0 and white 255,255,255.

Usage:
% cd applications/rendering/tilesAtHome/tools/png2tileinfo
% svn update
% perl png2tileinfo.pl check 3762 2471
oceantiles_12.png(3762, 2471) = 3 (mixed)
% perl png2tileinfo.pl set 3762 2471 land
% perl png2tileinfo.pl

[wait until file generated...]

% cp oceantiles_12.dat ../..
% cd ../..
% svn commit

These programs are all designed to be run simultaneously

*** DO NOT USE ***

Data flow:
  requests -> download -> transform -> render -> split -> blankTiles -> compress -> upload


Done:
* requests - downloads rendering requests from server, stores them as empty files
* download - downloads OSM data for each request
* transform - osmarenders data into SVG files
* render - renders the SVG file into tileset images containing loads of tiles at each zoom level
  (only one copy of render can be running at once)
* split - splits those images into separate tiles
* blankTiles - detects and removes blank tile images
* compress - adds multiple tiles to a zip file, to make uploading more efficient
* upload - uploads the ZIP files to server

OSM WMS
=======



Overview
--------

This script simply tries to implement a OGC-compliant WMS service.

By now, there is only one available layer, with very basic rendering, and only one projection (EPSG 4326)



Usage
-----

Simply copy all files to a PHP-enabled web server, and point your favorite WMS client to wms.php.

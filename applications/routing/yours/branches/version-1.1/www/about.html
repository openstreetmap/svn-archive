				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>This website is about making a routeplanner using OpenSource software and data as much as possible.
				The OpenStreetMap geographic data is the most important part in this project. 
				While being nowhere near complete enough to be able to say that it covers the whole world, it contains some pretty complete data for countries like: the Netherlands, United Kingdon, United States and Germany. 
				Some other countries are not far behind. 
				So the time is there to actually put the OpenStreetMap data to use. 
				This website being one of the possible useable scenarios.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Gosmore is usually very quick in returning a route, often a route is calculated in under 0.1 seconds and downloading the resulting route takes more time. If it takes more then 30 seconds to calculate a route then you can assume there is some problem in the underlying OSM data and often your route won't be complete. The route data is updated once a week after a new planet dump is available, so it is possible that the map is not always in sync with the routing engine.

				<h3>Things to do (in random order)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><del>Interface with Gosmore to find routes using KML.</del></li>
					<li><del>Use the Namefinder service to find the 'To' and 'From' coordinates.</del></li>
					<li><del>Add controls for travel methods (motorcar, cycle, foot) available in Gosmore.</del></li>

				<h3>Creating a route</h3>
				<p>Determine a TO and FROM coordinate (markers) which can be done with two methods (or a combination of):
					<ul>
						<li>- By using the TO and FROM buttons. Click one of these buttons and then click on the map to add a marker. Repeat for the other button.</li>
						<li>- By searching for a given street and city combination. This feature uses the nameserver to translate names to coordinates. See <a href=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Namefinder>here for more info</a> on how to use these fields.</li>
					</ul>
				A route is automatically generated as soon both markers are placed on the map. If a route is found it will plot it on the map, otherwise an error description will appear.
				<h3>Changing route parameters</h3>
				You can change the route parameters (e.g. from 'Car' to 'Bicycle') and when you click the FIND ROUTE button a new calculation is performed based on the given parameters.
				<h3>Partial new route (single click map/routing data testing)</h3>
				If you click on the map again a new TO or FROM marker is placed and a new route is calculated. This is very handy for mappers when testing the route network of a certain area. Once you've spotted a bug in the data you can click on the 'EDIT MAP' button and the online 'Potlatch' map data editor is automatically loaded with the current map view.
				<h3>Completely new route</h3>
				Click the CLEAR button if you want to generate a completely new route (or when things go wrong, which happens sometimes...). This should work as a rest. If the site continues to be non-functional please try a forced reload of your browser by pressing ctrl-F5.

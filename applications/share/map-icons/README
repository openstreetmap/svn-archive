This is the general OSM Map-Icons directory. 
All the icons in these directories have to get an 
entry into the map-features.xml file. So we have one common 
place for all icons used for drawing maps.
We currently have three subdirectories representing 
the three icon schemes(classic,square.big,square.small).
This means that the user can choose between those 
three (for now) styles for rendering. The three styles 
are represented in the three directories:
  - classic: normally no frames, no borders, transparent 
             but if you are unsure put the icons here
  - square.big: these icons all have a square shaped frame,
             where the color of the frame tells which category they belong to.
  - square.small: similar to the above(square.big), only smaller

Inside these directories the icons are structured by category. 
Where every category has it's own sub-directory. 
There are the following top-categories: 
      - accommodation
      - education
      - food
      - geocache
      - health
      - money
      - nautical
      - misc
      - people
      - places
      - public
      - recreation
      - religion
      - shopping
      - sightseeing
      - sports
      - transport
      - unknown
      - vehicle
      - waypoint
      - wlan
Each of these categories except 'unknown' can have sub-categories. If you 're
adding more icons you should try to put them into one of the existing
categories. For each (sub-)category we have a category-icon which is named
like the category directory. So for example, for the directory <style>/food/
we have to have an icon <style>/food.png. The same always applies to each
sub-sub-directory. before you start a sub-category you'll have to create an
icon for this subcategory. This way the renderer can always take the category
icon if there does not exist a specific icon for this.
If you are not sure where to put the icon you should consider using 
the others category(directory).
There are also some png files with size 0 in the directories. These files
are placeholders for possible icons and poi-types.

This is the general OSM Map-Icons directory. 
All the icons in these directories have to get an 
entry into the map-features.xml file. So we have one common 
place for all icons used for drawing maps.

Discussions showed that probably the best Licence for all the 
icons would be a PD-Style Licence. Because this wouldn't interfeer
with any use which is planed. So we expect new icons inserted here
to be PD-Style-Licence

We currently have six subdirectories representing 
the six icon schemes(classic,square.big,square.small,svg,jp).
This means that the user can choose between those 
six (for now) styles for rendering. The styles 
are each represented in there directories:
  - classic: normally no frames, no borders, transparent 
             but if you are unsure put the icons here
  - square.big: these icons all have a square shaped frame,
             where the color of the frame tells which category they belong to.
  - square.small: similar to the above(square.big), only smaller
  - svg: these are vectorgrafics in svg-format.
  - jp:  these are japanese map-sign, as found in openclipart and wikipedia
For the two svg directories there also exists an thumbnails directory which holds 
thumbnails for easier viewing on a website, ... These thumbnails directories
 (svg_tn, jp_tn) are only created by the build process. This is the reason 
they are not found in svn (any more).
The build proccess also takes care of filling up directories from others if it 
thinks this is usefull and possible.

Inside these directories the icons are structured by category. 
Where every category has it's own sub-directory. 
There are the following top-categories: 
      - accommodation
      - education
      - food
      - geocache
      - health
      - money
      - nautical
      - misc
      - people
      - places
      - public
      - recreation
      - religion
      - shopping
      - sightseeing
      - sports
      - transport
      - unknown
      - vehicle
      - waypoint
      - wlan
Each of these categories except 'unknown' can have sub-categories. If you 're
adding more icons you should try to put them into one of the existing
categories. For each (sub-)category we have a category-icon which is named
like the category directory. So for example, for the directory <style>/food/
we have to have an icon <style>/food.png. The same always applies to each
sub-sub-directory. Before you start a sub-category you'll have to create an
icon for this subcategory. This way the renderer can always take the category
icon if there does not exist a specific icon for this.
If you are not sure where to put the icon you should consider using 
the misc (directory misc).

THE ICON FILES: 
----------------

The file format for the icons has to be PNG, transparency allowed.
The image size should be 16x16, 24x24 or 32x32 pixels, but can be any size,
that is suitable for your icon theme.
The icon name should be english, lowercase and must not contain dots or
whitespaces.


THE STRUCTURE:
---------------

	map-icons/<theme>
		the icons belonging to theme <theme>
		Each Scheme has a unique loook.

	map-icons/classic
		this will hold the `old` gpsdrive icons from J. Ostertag

	map-icons/square.big
	map-icons/square.small
		the first icon themes designed for the new structure

	map-icons/svg
		A set of Icons drawn in svg. So these are scaleable

	map-icons/japan
		Japanese Style Map icons

	map-icons/svg-twotone
		SVG-Icons kept in two color Tones.

GUIDELINES:
------------

Each of these directories has to contain at least one icon for each of the
(twenty) base categories, e.g. shopping.png for the category "Shopping" and a
corresponding subfolder with the same name, containing at least one icon called
"empty.png". Optionally you can place additional sub icons into those folders,
to allow a more precise classification of the related POI.
If it should be necessary, one can add other sub-subfolders.

Example:

	map-icons/themename/

amr2wav is intended for use in audio mapping using mobile phones, which tend to
produce '.amr' audio files, whereas JOSM likes .wav files.
amr2wav does two things:
  1.  It scans through a GPX file and where it finds an audio waypoint, it adds
       a <link href=....> tag which can be read by josm.
  2.  It convers the associated .amr file to a .wav file using ffmpeg.

Note that the version of ffmpeg that comes with Ubuntu does not support amr,
so you may need to re-compile ffmpeg from sources.

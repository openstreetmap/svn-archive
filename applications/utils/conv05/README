API 0.4->0.5 and 0.5->0.4 Conversion Scripts
============================================

These scripts convert v0.4 OSM files to v0.5 and vice versa.  They take input
from stdin and print the converted file to stdout:

  $ ./04to05.pl <old.osm >new.osm

04to05.pl should be able to convert JOSM's action attribute, so you can
probably hand it a OSM files with modifications saved from JOSM that you can
upload to the 0.5 server.

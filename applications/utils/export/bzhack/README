An open source tool to access the OSM data from
planet.bz2 directly by a generated index to bz2 blocks.

The big advantage is one can use every HTTP mirror site which host
planet.bz2 without requiring users to (completely) download, extract and
load the file in a database. 
I'm also planning to use HTTP range requests to seek in the remote bz2
file.

This tool will create the following indexes, ordered by byte offset in
planet.osm.bz2:
- bznodeindex (byte offset, node id)
- bzwayindex (byte offset, way id)
- bzrelationindex (byte offset, relation id)

The following data tile indexes will be generated (at zoom 15):
- nodetile (node id, tile lat, tile lon)
- waytile (way id, tile lat, tile lon), duplicate records if the nodes of a way
  are on multiple data tiles
- relationtile (relation id, tile lat, tile lon), duplicate records if the nodes
  or ways are on multiple data tiles

To improve searching the data tiles are sorted by id:
- nodetile.srt
- waytile.srt
- relationtile.srt

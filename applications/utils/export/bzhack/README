An open source tool to access the OSM data from
planet.bz2 directly by a generated index to bz2 blocks.

The big advantage is one can use every HTTP mirror site which host
planet.bz2 without requiring users to (completely) download, extract and
load the file in a database. 
I'm also planning to use HTTP range requests to seek in the remote bz2
file.

osm2pgsql
=========
Converts OSM planet.osm data to a PostgreSQL database suitable 
for rendering into map tiles by Mapnik.

The format of the database is optimised for ease of rendering
by mapnik. It may be less suitable for other general purpose
processing.

For a broader view of the whole map rendering tool chain see

readme and may include answers to issues not mentioned here.

Source code
===========
The latest source code is available in the OSM SVN repository 
and can be downloaded as follows:

$ svn co http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/export/osm2pgsql

Build requirements
==================
The code is written in C and C++ and relies on the libraries
below:
- libxml2    http://xmlsoft.org/
- geos       http://geos.refractions.net/
- proj       http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/
- bzip2      http://www.bzip.org/
- zlib       http://www.zlib.net/
- PostgreSQL http://www.postgresql.org/
- PostGIS    http://postgis.refractions.net/

To make use of the database generated by this tool you will
probably also want to install:
- Mapnik from http://mapnik.org/



Building
========
Make sure you have installed the development packages for the 
libraries mentioned in the requirements section and a C and C++
compiler.

e.g. on Fedora:
# yum install geos-devel proj-devel postgresql-devel libxml2-devel bzip2-devel gcc-c++

On most Unix-like systems the program can be compiled by
running 'make'.

Operation
=========
You must create a PostgreSQL user and a database with the 
postgis functions enabled. This requires access as the
database administrator, normally the 'postgres' user.

The default name for this database is 'gis' but this may
be changed by using the osm2pgsql --database option.

If the <username> matches the unix user id running the import
and rendering then this allows the PostgreSQL 'ident sameuser'
authentication to be used which avoids the need to enter a
password when accessing the database. This is setup by default
on many Unix installs but does not work on Windows (due to the
lack of unix sockets).

Some example commands are given below but you may find
this wiki page has more up to data information:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapnik/PostGIS

$ sudo -u postgres createuser <username>
$ sudo -u postgres createdb -E UTF8 -O <username> <dbname>
$ sudo -u postgres createlang plpgsql <dbname>

Adding the postgis extensions. Note the location of the
lwpostgis.sql file may vary.

$ sudo -u postgres psql -d <dbname> -f /usr/share/postgresql-8.3-postgis/lwpostgis.sql

Next we need to give the <username> access to update the postgis
metadata tables

$ sudo -u postgres psql -d <dbname> -c "ALTER TABLE geometry_columns OWNER TO <username>"
$ sudo -u postgres psql -d <dbname> -c "ALTER TABLE spatial_ref_sys  OWNER TO <username>"

The 900913 is not normally included with postgis. To add it you
should run:

$ sudo psql -u postgres psql -d <dbname> -f 900913.sql


If you want to update your database with the diffs then you will
need to enable the PostgreSQL intarray contrib module. These 
contrib scripts are not installed by default and are often 
supplied in an additional package (e.g. postgresql-contrib).

$ sudo yum install postgresql-contrib
$ sudo -u postgres psql -d <dbname> -f /usr/share/pgsql/contrib/_int.sql



Now you can run osm2pgsql to import the OSM data.
This will perform the following actions:

1) Osm2pgsql connects to database and creates the following 4 tables:
   - planet_osm_point
   - planet_osm_line
   - planet_osm_roads
   - planet_osm_polygon
The prefix "planet_osm" can be changed with the --prefix option, 
the above is the default.

2) Runs an XML parser on the input file (typically planet.osm) 
 and processes the nodes, ways and relations.

3) If a node has a tag declared in the style file then it is 
 added to planet_osm_point. If it has no such tag then
 the position is noted, but not added to the database.

4) Ways are read in converted into WKT geometries by using the 
 postitions of the nodes read in earlier. If the tags on the way 
 are listed in the style file then the way will be written into
 the line or roads tables.

5) If the way has one or more tags marked as 'poloygon' and 
 forms a closed ring then it will be added to the lanet_osm_polygon
 table.

6) The relations are parsed. Osm2pgsql has special handling for a
 limited number of types: multipolygon, route, boundary
 The code will build the appropriate geometries by referencing the
 members and outputing these into the database.

7) Indexes are added to speed up the queries by Mapnik.


A quick note on projections
===========================

Depending on the command-line switches you can select which projection you
want the database in. You have three choices:

4326: The standard lat/long coordinates
900913: The spherical mercator projection, used by TileCache, Google Earth etc.
3395: The legacy (broken) WGS84 mercator projection

Depending on what you're using one or the other is appropriate. The default
mapnik style (osm.xml) assumes that the data is stored in 900913 and this 
is the default for osm2pgsql.

Combining the -v and -h switches will tell about the exact definitions of
the projections.

In case you want to use some completely different projection there is the -E
option. It will initialise the projection as +init=epsg:<num>. This allows
you to use any projection recognised by proj4, which is useful if you want
to make a map in a different projection. These projections are usually
defined in /usr/share/proj/epsg.

Database Access Examples
========================
If you wish to access the data from the database then the
queries below should give you some hints. Note that these 
examples all use the 'latlong' projection which is not the
default.

$ psql gis
gis=> \d
               List of relations
 Schema |        Name        | Type  |  Owner
--------+--------------------+-------+----------
...
 public | planet_osm_line    | table | jburgess
 public | planet_osm_point   | table | jburgess
 public | planet_osm_polygon | table | jburgess
 public | planet_osm_roads   | table | jburgess
...

gis=> \d planet_osm_line
  Table "public.planet_osm_line"
  Column   |   Type   | Modifiers
-----------+----------+-----------
 osm_id    | integer  |
 name      | text     |
 place     | text     |
 landuse   | text     |
... [ lots of stuff deleted ] ...
 way       | geometry | not null
 z_order   | integer  | default 0


Each of the tables contains a subset of the planet.osm file representing
a particular geometry type
- Point contains nodes which have interesting tags
  e.g. place=city, name=London
  
- Line contains ways with interesting tags
  e.g. highway=motorway, ref=M25
  
- Polygon contains ways which form an enclosed area
  e.g. landuse=reservoir

The DB columns are used as follows:
- osm_id = the planet.osm ID of the node(point) or way(line,polygon)
- name, place, landuse, ... = the value of the given key, if present on
the node/way. If the tag is not present, the value is NULL. Only a
subset of all possible tags are stored in the DB. Only ones rendered in
the osm.xml are actually interesting to mapnik.
- way = PostGIS geometry describing the physical layout of the object.


Querying specific data requires knowlege of SQL and the OSM key/value
system, e.g.

gis=> select osm_id,astext(way),name from planet_osm_point where amenity='cinema' limit 5;
  osm_id  |                  astext                   |        name
----------+-------------------------------------------+--------------------
 26236284 | POINT(-79.7160836579093 43.6802306464618) |
 26206699 | POINT(51.4051989797638 35.7066045032235)  | Cinema Felestin
 26206700 | POINT(51.3994885141459 35.7058460359352)  | Cinema Asr-e Jadid
 20979630 | POINT(151.225781789807 -33.8943079539886) | Paris Cinema
 20979684 | POINT(151.226855394904 -33.8946830511095) | Hoyts
(5 rows)

Mapnik renders the data in each table by applying the rules in the
osm.xml file.


> How could I get e.g. all highways in a given bounding box?

The 'way' column contains the geo info and is the one which you need to
use in your WHERE clause. e.g.

gis=> select osm_id,highway,name from planet_osm_line where highway is not null and way && GeomFromText('POLYGON((0 52, 0.1 52, 0.1 52.1, 0 52.1, 0 52))',4326);
 
osm_id  |   highway    |       name

osm2shp - the osm to shape conversion application.


The following is copied from a corresponding mail thread about dependencies
(http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2007-May/013854.html):

You also need to supply the shapefile to store areas, and the XML file which 
differentiates, by tags, polylines and areas. (This is in SVN in the libosm 
directory - it's the file features.xml)

You also need the "libosm" and, I think, "ccoord" library available from 
the "libs" directory of the source tree.
With "libosm", once you have done "make", you can use "make install" (as 
root) to copy the library to /usr/local/lib and the header files to 
/usr/local/include.

With "ccoord" there is no "make install" option (I would add one but have 
no access to SVN from where I am now), so you should enter "make" and then 
manually type (as root)

cp libccoord.a /usr/local/lib
cp *.h /usr/local/include

You can then change directory to osm2shp (I can't find this in the latest 
SVN by the way... is it still there?), and then type "make". It should 
work - let me know if not (together with error messages).

There are other dependencies too: you need shapelib (library for creating 
shapefiles) and expat 2.0 (simple XML parser). These compile and install 
without problems using a standard ./configure followed by make and make 
install.

These are available from:

shapelib.maptools.org/ 
expat.sourceforge.net/

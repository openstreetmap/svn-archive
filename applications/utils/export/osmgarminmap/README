****************************************************************************

  IMPORTANT!

  OSMGarminMap has not been updated to work with API 0.5 files. We recommend
  you use the "Mkgmap" program instead which works with API 0.5 files and
  is faster and easier to use.

  See: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Mkgmap

This program will convert OpenStreetMap .osm-Files into maps that can be
loaded into Garmin GPS devices.

It supports showing nodes, segments, ways and areas using Garmin icons etc.

You will also need the "cGPSmapper" program and its companion "sendmap".
These programs are not Open Source but there is a free version for
personal use which you can download from http://www.cgpsmapper.com/ .


CREATING A MAP
--------------
Download some data from OpenStreetMap Server and save it into a file called
"data.osm". You can then call "make" and it will generate the Garmin map
file in several steps. The makefile uses xsltproc, but it is easy to change
to use other XSLT engines. You also have to change the location of the
cGPSmapper program in the Makefile.

If there is a problem or you want to know about the details, here is a
step-by-step description:

1. OSM -> MPX
   In the first step this data will be converted from the OSM XML format
   into an XML format that is much nearer to the format that Garmin
   devices can understand. Mapping from the OSM format to the Garmin
   format you have to decide which OSM features should be mapped to which
   Garmin features. To describe this process, you can change the osm2mpx.xml
   File. It uses the same rules as Osmarender uses. In fact I "stole"
   some of the Osmarender code for this.

   xsltproc osm2mpx.xml >map.mpx

2. MPX -> MPL
   The second step will convert this XML format to a legacy format called
   the Polish format which can then be read by cGPSmapper. This is where
   the symbolic names in the .mpx file will get translated into hex codes.

   xsltproc feature-list.xml >map.mpl

3. MPL -> MP

   Remove zero length segments from polylines.

   mpl2mp.pl map.mpl >map.mp

4. MP -> IMG
   This file can then be read by cGPSmapper, which will create a .img file.

   cgpsmapper-static map.mp

   This will take a moment. You'll see some output from cGPSmapper ending
   with:
    Done!
    File :map.img is ready to use


TRANSFERRING MAP TO GPS UNIT
----------------------------
Now you can take this file and transfer it to your GPS unit using the
sendmap program which is also available from the cGPSmapper website.

  sendmap20 map.img

You might need to use some options depending on where your GPS unit is
attached (serial port/USB). You might need to be root. Call sendmap
without any parameters to get help.


DEVICES
-------

This was tested on my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx. Works reasonably well.


MAP FEATURES
------------

The list of map features is created from the OpenOffice spreadsheet file
called feature-list.ods. To change anything, change this spreadsheet file,
save as CSV with the vertical bar (|) as field delimiter and no text
delimiter. Then run the feature-list-csv2xml.pl file like this:

./feature-list-csv2xml.pl feature-list.csv >feature-list.xml


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

* The list of map features that Garmin offers is not complete. The list
  was created from some incomplete stuff I found on the web. If you find
  any other code for other features please tell me.

* Currently the conversion of OSM features into Garmin features is very
  basic. The usual highways are included as well as parks and forests
  and some amenities like parking lots and telephones. I welcome any
  additions.

* Ways will be put into the Garmin map not one segment at a time, but
  as a complete way. If the segments are not ordered properly along the
  way (something which can easily happen in OSM when adding new segments
  to a way) you'll get spurious segments zigzaggin around the map. I'll
  probably not fix this in OSMGarminMap, because it should be fixed in
  the database itself. That way the fix will help everybody, regardless
  in which way they are using the data.
 
  If you have bad data, you can use the included fix.xsl style sheet
  created by Ludwig Max Brinckmann to first fix your OSM data files. This
  will find all non-contiguous ways and split them into one way per segment.
  Use it like this:
  xsltproc fix.xsl data.osm >data-with-fix.osm

* OSMGarminMap ignores tagged segments.

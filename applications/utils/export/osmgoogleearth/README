******************************************************************************

  IMPORTANT!
  
  OSMGoogleEarth has not been updated to use the 0.5 API. It is recommended
  that you use the Export package of the newer Ruby OSM Library which also
  does KML export and is faster and more flexible. See
  http://osmlib.rubyforge.org/osmlib-export/

Transform OpenStreetMap .osm file into KML file for Google Earth. 

You need a file called data.osm. When you call make a file map.kmz will
be generated. This file contains a Google Earth KML file and some icons.

Load it into Google Earth with the menu "Add" -> "Network Link...". It
will appear in the Places list. Double click it there to fly to the
place.

Currently only some streets, parks, and parking lots are shown, but it
is easy to improve on this.

The isle_of_wight.kmz file is provided as an example.

On Linux and other Unix-Like systems you can use the shellscript with the 
config file to update multiple locations in one go. Use sparingly.

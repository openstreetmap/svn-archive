README for merge-ways
---------------------

merge-ways is intended as a preprocessor for certain rendering or other actions
performed on OSM files.

It finds adjoining ways and merges them into one way provided they share certain 
characterstics. Which characterstics these are is expressed in a function at the 
top of the script.

It does not yet handle relations (might even break them by removing a way that
was used by a relation).

Another known bug is that it will happily join the opposing lanes of a dual carriageway
if they meet at an intersection, often leading to the street name written in a 180
degree bend around the end of the street.

The primary use is as a preprocessor for Osmarender when streets are split in many
ways, none of which large enough to contain the street name.

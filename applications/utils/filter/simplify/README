Simplify OSM by removing invisible data at high zome levels

When displaying a map of the whole of the UK there is no point including
information on nodes < 1km apart since this will be less then 1 pixel
This script removes the redundant data using the following algorithm

Some code taken from check-osm.pl by Joerg Ostertag
 
User specifies the minimum "interesting" square grid size in degrees.

The rough design is as follows.

 
Read in nodes from OSM file
 - Lat / Lon is quantised to nearest multiple of the specified grid size
 - If this is a new unique location, it gets added as a new node.
 - Otherwise, a small node entry is created pointing back to the existing node for this square
 - The position of the node representing this grid square is the average of all nodes within the square.

Read in all segments
 - Lookup the to/from endpoints in the node table.
 - If these nodes are duplicate entries then lookup the node representing this grid position
 - If to/from map to the same grid position then discard the segment
 - Search segments list to see if a segment for this to/from pair exists
 - If this is a new segment, add it to the list.
 - If pair already exists, add a small entry pointing to the existing segment

Read in all ways, for each segment in a way
 - Find each segment in the segment list.
 - If segment not present then assume if maps to the same from/to quantised position and discard.
 - If this entry is a duplicate segment entry, locate the unique segment for this node pair.
 - Look through list of segments for this way, discard if already present in list for this way
 
When all segments for a way have been processed
 - Discard if the way has no segment entries (e.g. doesn't cross a grid square boundary).

 
Once all data has been read in.
 - Delete duplicate node & segment entries leaving just those that we want
 - Write out the simplified OSM file.



Usage:
    Common usages:

    simplify.pl [-d] [-v] [-h] --simplify=<Degrees> [--osm-file=planet.osm]
    [--out=<filename>]

Options:
    --man Complete documentation
      Complete documentation

    --no-mirror
      Do not try mirroring the files from the original Server. Only use
      files found on local Filesystem.

    --proxy
      use proxy for download

    --osm-file=path/planet.osm
      Select the "path/planet.osm" file to use for the checks

    --simplify=0.1
      Remove all features of less then "0.1" degrees

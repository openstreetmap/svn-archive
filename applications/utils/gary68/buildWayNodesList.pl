# buildWayNodesList.pl

# program takes osm file (preferably a whole planet) and builds a file that contains just lines of wayIds and the number of nodes contained in that way.
# this information can be used by programs that use only portions of the planet file to determine whether a way was cut of by using bounding boxes 
# or polygons.

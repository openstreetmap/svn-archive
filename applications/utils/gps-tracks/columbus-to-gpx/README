Columbus V-900 to GPX conversion program.  Written by Russ Nelson,
<russ@cloudmade.com>.  This program is in the public domain.

To use it, copy all the files from the Columbus's Micro-SD card into a
subdirectory.  Run the enclosed python program, naming all the .CSV files
on the command line.  It doesn't hurt to rewrite existing files, so this
command line is appropriate:
	./columbus-to-gpx.py *.CSV

The WAV files should have a lower-case extension (".wav"), should your
operating system have case-sensitive filenames.

Changes since 16010:
  o Moved the lat/lon to the beginning of the recording rather than the end.
    The beginning is more easily chosen.
  o convinced it to generate GPX 1.1 output, the better to work with JOSM.
  o It now prints out the filename of the file it's processing.

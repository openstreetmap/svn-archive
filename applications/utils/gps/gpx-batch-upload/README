This Perl script extracts a GPX file from a PostgreSQL database
and uploads it to the OpenStreetMap site via an HTTP POST.

The HTTP POST performs a login with password using a cookie,
the cookie is stored in a permanent file and eventually reused.

The cookie become invalid if - in the meantime - the same userid
logs-in via another user agent (browser).

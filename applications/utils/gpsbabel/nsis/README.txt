GPSBabel Windows installer generator

You'll also need:

a) an installed nsis http://nsis.sourceforge.net
b) the contents of the GPSBabel Windows binary zip file from http://www.gpsbabel.org. 

As of writing this doc (GPSBabel 1.3.4), unzip the gpsbabel binaries into a dir gpsbabel-1.3.4 parallel to this file.

If you want to use a different GPSBabel version, change the VERSION setting in gpsbabel.nsi and zip the binaries into a corresponding dir. 
You might also need to change gpsbabel.nsi if the contents of the zip file changed.

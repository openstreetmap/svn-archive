This document includes the process to import the AND data

Note: this document is about the actual commands to acheive the desired
effect! Any discussion and details should be referred to:

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/AND_Data/Roadmap-integration-NL

As far as possible these steps are encoded in the Makefile, so editting to
indicate where your planet file is and running "make" will be sufficient in
most cases.

===========================================================================
Steps

1. Get latest planet dump
2. Get polygon representing the NL border (OSM format)

Ante  is working on the border. His latest version can be found in:
http://people.vrijschrift.org/~ante/osm/

3. Convert polygon from OSM format to "polygon" format

For example: 

perl -w osm2polygon.pl data/nldgrens.osm >data/nldpolygon.txt

4. Get polygons representing protected areas (OSM format)
5. Convert protected areas to "polygon" format
6. Use extract-polygon to extract the current NL data (takes > 1 hour)

For example:

../../osm-extract/polygons/extract-polygon.pl -v -i $HOME/osm/planet-070815.osm -o data/nld.osm -p data/nldpolygon.txt

This includes a progress counter.

7. Use planetosm-deleteby-tags.pl to create file in OSM format indicating
   what needs to be deleted.

For example:
./planetosm-deleteby-tags.pl data/nld.osm > data/nld-delete.osm	
Deleted: nodes:155290, segs:179150, ways:29651

(several steps relating to conversion of data, coming soon)

1. Get latest planet dump
2. Get polygon representing the NL border (OSM format)

Ante  is working on the border. His latest version can be found in:

3. Convert polygon from OSM format to "polygon" format

For example: 

perl -w osm2polygon.pl data/nldgrens.osm >data/nldpolygon.txt

4. Get polygons representing protected areas (OSM format)
5. Convert protected areas to "polygon" format
6. Use extract-polygon to extract the current NL data
7. Use planetosm-deleteby-tags.pl to create file in OSM format indicating
   what needs to be deleted.

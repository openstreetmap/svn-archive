# Field:  Description:
#      1  The shapefile types to match (outer, inner, line, point) (see below)
#      2  The source attribute name to match
#      3  The source attribute value to match. Can be empty to match all values.
#      4  The name of the tag to apply when the source key/value pair match.
#      5  The value of the tag to apply. Use a sinlgle dash ("-") to use the original value.

#note,Road segment - ( Segment routier )	 
#A road is a linear section of the earth designed for or the result of vehicular movement. 
#A road segment is the specific representation of a portion of a road with uniform characteristics. 
#When crossing roads are separated by grades, the bisecting road segments do not share a junction. 
#Grade separated crossings between road segments involve road structure objects, that is, either bridges or tunnels. 
#If a junction occurs at a grade separation, it is either connected to the lower set of road segments or to the higher, 
#but never to both. Proposed roads are not represented.

# Field:  Description:
#      1  The shapefile types to match (outer, inner, line, point) (see below)
#      2  The source attribute name to match
#      3  The source attribute value to match. Can be empty to match all values.
#      4  The name of the tag to apply when the source key/value pair match.
#      5  The value of the tag to apply. Use a sinlgle dash ("-") to use the original value.

# The shape file types are:
#  outer  = The outer polygon of a MultiPolygon
#  inner  = The inner polygon of a MultiPolygon
#  line   = A line string of a MultiLineString
#  point  = A point of a PointString

=head1 NAME

Geo::OSM - Upload data to OpenStreetMap

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Geo::OSM;
  my $osm = new Geo::OSM;
  $osm->setup("user\@domain.com","password","my_useragentname");
  $osm->tempfiles("temp1.txt", "temp2.txt");
  
  $osm->uploadNode($Lat, $Long, $Tags);
  $osm->uploadSegment($Node1, $Node2, $Tags);
  $osm->uploadWay($Tags, @Segments);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to upload data to OpenStreetMap, using its REST API

=head2 Methods

=over 12

=item C<new>

Returns a new Geo::OSM object.

=item C<setup($Username,$Password,$UserAgent)>

Username is typically an email address, remembering that the @ symbol must be escaped in string

Password is your openstreetmap password

User Agent is a name to identify your program.  It will be added in the "created_by" tag to make it easier for people to identify features your program has created

=item C<tempfiles($File1, $File2)>

Two files that get used by CURL for sending and receiving POST data

=item C<uploadNode($Lat, $Long, $Tags)>

Uploads a node to OpenStreetMap, and returns the index of the new node, or 0 if it couldn't be created.

Latitude and Longitude are in degrees, reference to WGS-84 

Tags are of the form <tag k="amenity" v="pub"/>

See "Map Features" page on the OpenStreetMap wiki for a list of tags that are typically used

=item C<uploadSegment($FromNode, $ToNode, $Tags)>

Uploads a segment to OpenStreetMap, and returns the index of the new segment, or 0 if it couldn't be created.

FromNode and ToNode are the indexes of two nodes

Tags are of the form <tag k="highway" v="motorway"/>

=item C<uploadWay($Tags, @Segments)>

Uploads a way (list of segments) to OpenStreetMap, and returns the index of the new way, or 0 if it couldn't be created.

Tags are same as used elsewhere

@Segments is an array of segment IDs

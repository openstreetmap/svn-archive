				csv2osm - CSV checking converter
				--------------------------------

This script will apply a set of user-supplied rules, to turn a CSV file
into OSM, and upload.

Along the way, it'll check to see if it's likely that the object already 
exists in OSM. If it thinks it might, it'll report the likely match, and
defer the upload.

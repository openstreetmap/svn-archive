THIS TOOL IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION WORK YET. SPECIFIC RULE SETS FOR THE 
VARIOUS PROVINCES HAVE YET TO BE DEVELOPED AND IN MANY CASES WILL BE DISTINCT
FROM THE NATIONAL RULE SET DUE TO VARIATIONS IN HOW EACH JURISDICTION CLASSIFIES
WHAT IS A ROAD.




Introduction:
-------------
This tool is designed to take a Canadian Geobase GML file (or files) and 
convert it to the representative OSM stucture.

This tool is designed to be compatible with the 0.5 API.

How to use:
-----------

python geobase2osm.py -i NRN_GEOM.gml [-a NRN_ADDR.gml] [-o output.osm] [--pretty]

-i filename = The National Road Network Geometry input file
-a filename = The National Road Network Address input file (optional)
-o filename = The file to save to
--pretty    = Create a indented and neatly formatted output file (can add a fair 
bit of whitespace)

Requirements:
-------------
Python 2.3 or higher
cElementTree (Note: you can use the native python ElementTree but its much slower. To 
do so change the relevant import line in the script)

The scripts in this directory convert USGS National Hydrography Datase
t shapefiles into osm files (currently version 0.5).  One script is pr
ovided for each shapefile in a NHD extract.  Care must be used in empl
oying these scripts because not every NHD ftype (feature type) is curr
ently supported.  The user must check the list of feature types in his
 subbasin, and verify that they are supported by this script.  If they
 are not, he will need to add support or not import the basin.

These scripts are based on the existing polyshp2osm and shape_to_osm e
ngines, but the engines have been modified to support maximum way leng
ths.  Complex multipolygons are used to allow all ways to be split whe
n they exceed the fixed length.

The SVN archive will be updated as newer versions become available.

Revisions:
22 Apr 2009:  The scripts now keep the files smaller than the specified
size, except in cases where a single feature has more objects than the
maximum number given.  Support for more ftypes.  Still OSM version 0.5

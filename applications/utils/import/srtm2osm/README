Overview
========

Utility to create contours in OSM format for use with OSMARENDER. This
is not intended for upload into the OSM database!

The SRTM height data needs to be obtained from :
http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/

The real work is done by gnuplot - however gnuplot is NOT GPL (despite
the name - apparently they thought of it first) and is being very
stubborn about changing.

Instructions
============

Determine the latitude and longitude of your map, and then download
the SRTM data in ASCII format from http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/

Unzip the file, and edit example.sh to include the name of that file,
and the bounding box of the map file. Your OSM file should be called
data.osm, or you can update example.sh to suit.

Run example.sh. 

contours.osm is created, which contains the actual contours in OSM format,
and map.osm, which contains both the contours and any map data supplied.

You will need to patch some rules into osmarender before rendering the map.
Do not load into JOSM or attempt to upload to OSM!

See osmarender4.diff for an example.

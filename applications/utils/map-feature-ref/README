This is a collection of stylesheets for generating quick reference
documents from the Map Features pages on the OpenStreetMap wiki[1].

REQUIREMENTS

  * Geo-OSM-MapFeatures <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Geo-OSM-MapFeatures/>
  * An XSLT processor:
    - xsltproc: <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
  * An XSL-FO processor:
    - FOP: <http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>


USAGE

To generate all files, simply run:

    make

The following files will be generated:

    mapfeatures-11-tab-sec.pdf
    mapfeatures-11-tab-sec.ps
    mapfeatures-1n-tab-sec.pdf
    mapfeatures-1n-tab-sec.ps

To generate only PDF documents:

    make pdf

To generate only PS documents:

   make ps

To generate a specific document run one of:

    make mapfeatures-11-tab-sec.pdf
    make mapfeatures-11-tab-sec.ps
    make mapfeatures-1n-tab-sec.pdf
    make mapfeatures-1n-tab-sec.ps

The name of each file is mnemonic to the style of the output:

  * ‘11’ means there is always a one‐to‐one mapping of keys to values,
    e.g.:

        highway     motorway
        highway     motorway_link
        highway     trunk
        …           …
        junction    roundabout

  * ‘1n’ means that there is a one‐to‐many mapping of keys to values,
    e.g:

        highway     motorway
                    motorway_link
                    trunk
                    …
        junction    roundabout

  * ‘tab’ means the tags are listed in tabular format.

  * ‘sec’ means tags are grouped into sections.

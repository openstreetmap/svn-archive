README for utils/osm-extract directory
--------------------------------------

This directory contains various scripts to extract part of an OSM file
(e.g. the planet file).

The "polygons" subdirectory contains a script that extracts based on a 
polygon or a set of polygons, as well as definitions of such polygons.

The planetosm-extract-area.pl and planetosm-extract-tags.pl scripts 
extract a rectangular area and/or items based on certain tag values.

osm-subset.pl does something similar but uses pre-defined bounding
boxes as opposed to bounding boxes specified on the command line.

Note: for tha AND import the code in the "polygons" subdirectory has been
significantly expanded. It handles excluding as well as including areas, can
read compressed planet dumps directly and can provide auxilliary data
related to nodes included but referenced by excluded stuff. At some point
the useful features should be ported to the other scripts also.

PLEASE EXPAND AND CHANGE THIS README IF YOU MAKE CHANGES!

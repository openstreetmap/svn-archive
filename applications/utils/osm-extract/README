README for utils/osm-extract directory
--------------------------------------

This directory contains various scripts to extract part of an OSM file
(e.g. the planet file).

The "polygons" subdirectory contains a script that extracts based on a 
polygon or a set of polygons, as well as definitions of such polygons.

The planetosm-extract-area.pl and planetosm-extract-tags.pl scripts 
extract a rectangular area and/or items based on certain tag values.

osm-subset.pl does something similar but uses pre-defined bounding
boxes as opposed to bounding boxes specified on the command line.

PLEASE EXPAND AND CHANGE THIS README IF YOU MAKE CHANGES!

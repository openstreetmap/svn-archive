README for utils/osm-extract directory
--------------------------------------

This directory contains various scripts to extract part of an OSM file
(e.g. the planet file).

The "polygons" subdirectory contains a script that extracts based on a 
polygon or a set of polygons, as well as definitions of such polygons
(but also see the java program "osmosis" which does similar things and
supports the same polygon format).
C version of this script is in "extract-polygon-c" subdirectory.

The planetosm-extract-area.pl and planetosm-extract-tags.pl scripts 
extract a rectangular area and/or items based on certain tag values.

"osmcut" is a program to cut an OSM file into several pieces of identical
size (identical in terms of degrees covered, not file size).

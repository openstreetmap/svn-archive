simplify-poly.pl: simplifies a polygon file as used by Osmosis et al.

options:

--slope=x (default: $slope) - with three points X(n),X(n+1),X(n+2), 
    the point X(n+1) will be removed if the length of the path over 
    all three points is less than "x" longer than the direct path 
    between X(n) and X(n+2).

--same=x (default: $same) - remove points that are nearer than "x" to
    their neighbours.

--percent=x (default: $percent) - remove corners with widest angles 
    until remaining polygon has only x% of the original number of nodes.

Note that for --slope and --same, distance is measured in degrees, so
gets distorted away from the equator.

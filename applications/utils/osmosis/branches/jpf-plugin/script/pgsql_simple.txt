The pgsql simple schema is a PostgreSQL schema utilising postgis extensions that is capable of storing a snapshot of OSM data.
No history is maintained.
It can be populated by osmosis and kept up to date with osmosis daily, hourly and minute changesets.

The following scripts are available:
pgsql_simple_schema_0.x.sql - The schema creation script.
pgsql_simple_schema_0.x_bbox.sql - A script for adding way bbox column support.  This is required for some osmosis tasks.
pgsql_simple_load_0.x.sql - A script for importing PostgreSQL "COPY" files as produced by the osmosis --write-pgsql-dump task.

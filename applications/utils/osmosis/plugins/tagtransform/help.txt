= Tag Transform Plugin =

The tag transform Osmosis plugin allows arbitrary tag transforms to be applied to OSM
data as a preprocessing step before using other tools. This allows other tools to concentrate
on doing what ever they do, without having to handle numerous different tagging schemes
and error corrections.

The transforms apply regular expressions to both the tag keys and values, and enable
customising output tags based on sub-matches.

== Downloading ==

The plugin is currently available [http://dev.openstreetmap.org/~random/tagtransform.jar here]

The code is GPL and available from OSM svn:
  http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/osmosis/plugins/tagtransform


== Installation ==

To install the plugin, place the tagtransform.jar file somewhere on your file-system. Somewhere
near osmosis maybe a good idea.

To automatically have osmosis load the plugin, edit either your /etc/osmosis or ~/.osmosis file
to show:
 OSMOSIS_OPTIONS="-p uk.co.randomjunk.osmosis.transform.TransformPlugin"

You also need to add the plugin to your classpath.

A suggested solution is:
  cd <osmosis dir>
  mkdir plugins
  mv <whereever it is>/tagtransform.jar plugins/

Edit the bin/osmosis file -- on the EXEC= line, replace with:
  EXEC="$JAVACMD $JAVACMD_OPTIONS -cp $MYAPP_HOME/osmosis.jar:$MYAPP_HOME/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.0.7-bin.jar:$MYAPP_HOME/lib/postgresql-8.3-603.jdbc4.jar:$MYAPP_HOME/lib/postgis_1.3.2.jar:$MYAPP_HOME/plugins/* $MAINCLASS $OSMOSIS_OPTIONS $@"


== Running a transform ==

The tasks provided are:

====--tag-transform (--tt)====
Transform the tags in the input stream according to the rules specified in a transform file.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Pipe
! Description
|-
| inPipe.0
| Consumes an entity stream.
|-
| outPipe.0
| Produces an entity stream.
|}


{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Option
! Description
! Valid Values
! Default Value
|-
| file
| The name of the file containing the transform description.
|
| transform.xml
|-
| stats
| The name of a file to output statistics of match hit counts to.
|
| N/A
|}

== Specifying a transform ==

Transforms are specified as an XML file containing a series of translations. Each translation is made up of the
following parts:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Part
! Required
! Description
|-
| name
| 
| Name of the translation -- used in stats output
|-
| description
| 
| Description of the translation for your own sanity and stats output
|-
| match
| '''Y'''
| Specifies the conditions that must be met for the output to be applied
|-
| find
|
| Specifies extra tags used in output that are not essential to achieve a match
|-
| output
|
| Specifies the tags to be output when an entity is matched
|}

Translations are executed on each entity, with the output of the first translation used as the input for the second etc.

 
=== match and find ===

There are a couple of different match types. The top level element must be ''match'' or ''find''.

==== match ====

The match element groups together other matches. It has two modes:
* '''and''' (default) -- all contained matches must match (checking will stop at the first non-match)
* '''or''' -- only one of the contained matches must match (all are checked regardless)

'''find''' is a special case of '''or'''-mode and can only be used as a top level tag.

The entity type to enable matches for can also be specified. Valid values are '''all''' (default), '''node''', '''way''',
and '''relation'''.

==== tag ====

Matches individual or groups of tags. Tags are selected by regular expressions. These are standard
Java regular expressions, and full information can be found at [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html].

Attributes are used to specify the regexes:
* '''k''' the key regex to match
* '''v''' the value regex to match
* '''match_id''' the ID to reference in output

The output may reference matches to output tags using the specified ID. Any groups extracted by the regex will be available to
the output.

==== notag ====

Matches on non-presence of tags. If any tag is matched by the regexes then a parent And matcher will fail.

* '''k''' the key regex to not match
* '''v''' the value regex to not match

=== output ===

The output is specified as a series of operations which are executed in order. Tag keys are considered unique, and so
any operation writing to an existing key will overwrite that existing tag.

'''If no output section is specified then any matching entities will be dropped entirely

==== copy-all ====
Copies all the original tags to the output unchanged.

==== copy-unmatched ====
Copies any tags not matched by match or find expressions.

==== copy-matched ====
Copies any tags which were matched by match or find expressions.

==== tag ====
Output a specific tag, or multiple tags if referencing a match. The key and values for the new tag(s)
are specified using output expressions. Within an output expression '''{0}''' will be replaced with
the matched regex group of that number. 0 represents the whole match string, and the 1st matched group
will be output by {1}.

The attributes used are:
* '''from_match''' -- the match_id to take values from
* '''k''' -- the key to output
* '''v''' -- the value to output

If the referenced match doesn't exist (ie: it was part of find or an "or" mode match and no matching tags
were found) then the tag output is omitted (even if groups aren't used in the strings).

If no match is referenced at all then the key and value are treated as simple strings and output
verbatim.


=== Examples ===

Many applications may require considerably less access types than are available (or frequently
mistyped):
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <translations>
 
  <translation>
    <name>Simplify Access</name>
    <description>Simplifies the access restrictions to yes/no. We could limit for specific keys, but lets live dangerously.</description>
    <match mode="or">
      <tag k=".*" match_id="yes" v="true|designated|public|permissive"/>
      <tag k=".*" match_id="no" v="false|private|privat"/>
    </match>
    <output>
      <copy-all/>
      <tag from_match="yes" v="yes"/>
      <tag from_match="no" v="no"/>
    </output>
  </translation>
  
 </translations>

(XML surround omitted from now on for clarity)

Convert a crossing tagged using the wiki-voted crossing scheme into the heavily used crossing=toucan used
in rendering the cyclemap:
  <translation>
    <name>->Toucan</name>
    <description>Convert wiki-voted crossings to toucans, and short-cut the crossing_ref case too</description>
    <match mode="or" type="node">
      <match>
        <tag k="crossing" v="traffic_signals"/>
        <tag k="bicycle" v="yes"/>
      </match>
      <tag k="crossing_ref" v="toucan"/>
    </match>
    <output>
      <copy-all/>
      <tag k="crossing" v="toucan"/>
    </output>
  </translation>

There have been many ways of entering cycle routes suggested... we tend to use relations now,
but lets regularise the legacy way tagging to ensure ncn=yes is placed on all ways
  <translation>
    <name>NCN</name>
    <description>Find all the way ncn way variations and tag consistently</description>
    <match>
      <match mode="or">
        <!-- this matches route=ncn, as well as route=bus;ncn etc. -->
        <tag k="route" v="(.*;|^)ncn(;.*|$)" match_id="route"/>
        <!-- sometimes ncn_ref has been specified without ncn=yes -->
        <tag k="ncn_ref" v=".*"/>
      </match>
      <!-- don't match where ncn was already set to something else -->
      <notag k="ncn" v=".*"/>
    </match>
    <output>
      <copy-all/>
      <tag k="ncn" v="yes"/>
      <!-- output the route tag, but without the ncn part -->
      <tag k="route" from_match="route" v="{1}{2}"/>
    </output>
  </translation>

I might not like the prefixes used by the piste:lift scheme for whatever reason. Lets remove them:
  <translation>
    <name>Arbitrary Piste Remapping</name>
    <description>Remap the piste:lift:* style tags to reduce tag length and remove ":" which aren't playing nice with tool X</description>
    <match type="way">
      <tag k="piste:lift" v=".*" match_id="type"/>
    </match>
    <find>
      <tag k="piste:lift:(.*)" v=".*" match_id="piste_attr"/>
    </find>
    <output>
      <copy-unmatched/>
      <tag from_match="type" k="piste_lift"/>
      <tag from_match="piste_attr" k="{1}" v="{0}"/>
    </output>
  </translation>

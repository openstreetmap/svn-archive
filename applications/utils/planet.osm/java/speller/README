This program will try to spellcheck the keynames used in OSM.
You need the latest planet dump to use it.

This program uses the bzip2.jar library. I got it from
<http://www.kohsuke.org/bzip2/> and got this license:
Apache Software License (see jar-file)

Compile in windows:
>"c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_08\bin\javac.exe" -classpath bzip2.jar *.java
Compile in linux:
>/opt/jdk1.6.0/bin/javac -encoding ISO8859-1 -classpath .:bzip2.jar *.java

Run:
java -classpath .;bzip2.jar -Xmx512m OSMspeller
/opt/jdk1.6.0/bin/java -classpath .:bzip2.jar -Xmx512m OSMspeller >stdout.log 2>stderr.log

NOTE: Due to delay it seems bad to run this of an network mounted volume.
At least if mounted from an old Samba-server.


TODO:

- Limit use of ctrl-c while writing resume-file
- sort word list alpabeticly
- interactive correcting of unknown spellings and save new misspellings in config file
- do spelling of values and attributes?

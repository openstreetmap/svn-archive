Pymap

Summary
-------
pymap is a viewer for OpenStreetMap maps. Maps are downloaded to the
local drive and are still available when offline. They will be
re-fetched if older than 30 days. As this is an OpenLayers
installation it will look and behave very similar to the standard map
on openstreetmap.org. pymap requires only python to run.

Description
-----------
Frustrated by the lack of a nice map viewing tool for my eee pc, I
have written my own hack. It's a local OpenLayers installation that is
served by a python script (stock python, no additional libs). If the
tile does not exist yet, it will be downloaded from the OSM tile
server and be stored locally, so those tiles will be available for
offline viewing.  Tiles will be downloaded and stored in a directory
called 'tiles' in the pymap directory. Tiles older than 30 days will be refetched. If anybody finds this tool
useful that is cool, otherwise I have just scratched my itch.

It's a total of 60 lines of code including the license... so go figure
how elaborate my error checking is. It works for me though...

How to install:
1) svn co http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/viewer/pymap

How to run:
1) cd pymap
2) python pymap (or ./pymap)
3) visit http://localhost:8000 and have fun.
4) press Ctrl-C to kill the server (if it still busy serving tiles you might have to press multiple times)

How to uninstall:
1) delete pymap directory

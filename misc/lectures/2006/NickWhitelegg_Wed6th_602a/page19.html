<h3>Problems and issues - Line segments passing through tile</h3>
<ul>
<li>Map is made up of tiles - the data for each tile is returned separately</li>
<li>All line segments with at least one point within the tile are 
returned from the database</li>
<li><em>Problem</em>: what about line segments which pass through the tile but 
begin and end outside?</li>
</ul>

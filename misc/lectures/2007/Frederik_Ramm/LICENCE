I hereby declare all my contributions to the OSM project - including
the slides in this directory - to be in the public domain, or whatever
your jurisdiction offers that is like public domain ;-)

My presentations may contain material from differently licensed sources
(like OSM or Google screenshots) but as they only serve illustrative
purposes and my presentations are not derivative works of these sources, 
they do not influence the "public domain"ness of the whole.

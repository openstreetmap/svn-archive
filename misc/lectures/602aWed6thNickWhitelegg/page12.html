<h3>Freemap and OpenStreetMap</h3>
<ul>
<li>About a year after I started Freemap, I became aware of Steve Coast's
<a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a> project, 
which was accomplishing a similar aim but (at the time) focused on city
streetmaps</li>
<li>It became apparent that it would make sense to have one centralised
database for free mapping data, so I approached Steve about collaboration</li>
<li>The conclusion was that Freemap data would be stored in OSM's database,
then Freemap would pull out the data from OSM and render it in its own
style</li>
</ul>

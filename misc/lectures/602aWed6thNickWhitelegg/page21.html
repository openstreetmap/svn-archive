<h3>Solutions - Line segments passing through tile</h3>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve not only data within the tile, but also data immediately 
outside
	<ul>
	<li>This will minimise the chance of the problem occurring</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>At more detailed scales, increase the area outside the tile to query
	<ul>
	<li>Necessary as the problem is more likely to happen (smaller 
	surface area)</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The problem can also be minimised by keeping the line segments short

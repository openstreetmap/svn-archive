<h3>Turning a GPS track into a meaningful map</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed a standalone desktop application (which later evolved into 
<em>osmeditor2</em>) which reads data from your GPS and allows you to partition 
the track into different types of right of way</li>
<li>These can then be uploaded to the database</li>
<li>Users can mark waypoints to remind them when the status of a right of way
changes, if they cannot work it out from turns in the GPS track, local 
knowledge etc</li>
</ul>

<h2>How did Freemap come about ...?</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 1998 I did a long distance walk from Sussex to the Peak District</li>
<li>When writing up the walk, I wanted to illustrate it with extracts of OS 
map, showing the route along with annotations</li>
<li>OS copyright prevented this without a fee (which was not insignificant
for the amount of extracts I wanted), so accurate illustration of my walk was 
not possible</li>
</ul>

<h2>How was the problem solved?</h2>
<ul>
<li>It  became apparent that a web application delivering free maps was the
best way forward</li>
<li>Paths and landscape features could be stored in a database, then a 
computer program residing on a website could generate a map dynamically by 
querying the database</li>
<li>How could one gather the data in the first place though?
	<ul>
	<li>Even reading the coordinates off an OS map and using them to create
	your own maps infringes their copyright</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

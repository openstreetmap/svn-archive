This directory contains files for an OSM flyer (in German) that was
created by Frederik Ramm <frederik@remote.org> and contributors from 
the talk-de list in January 2008.

All contents are in the public domain except those derived from OSM 
which are CC-BY-SA.

The flyer is designed for DIN A7 as the final size (105mm high and
74mm wide), with 8 pages in a zig-zag ("Leporello") fold, and full
colour printing.

The flyer was made with Inkscape; osmflyer1.svg and osmflyer2.svg
are the front and reverse side. 

Some notes in case you want to re-create something yourself:

world3.png created by Jochen Topf <jochen.topf@jtic.de> using Mapnik
and a Fahey projection, illustrating where we have good coverage.

berlin-background.png is basically an Osmarender rendering of Berlin,
using a standard stylesheet but with all captions removed, and the 
resulting PNG file processed with the Gimp roughly like this: First
convert to grayscale, then use colors->curves to narrow down contrast,
then convert back to RGB, then use colors->colorify to give it a nice
hue.

gpstrack.png is a screenshot with gimpically enhanced track points,
editnodes.png is a pure screenshot using a mappaint style file with
thicker lines, and final.png is a standard osmarender map.

Information
-----------

A general description of the name finder can be found at 
  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Name_finder

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need 

* a MySQL database with UTF-8 support. Structure is in the namefind.sql file
at the top level alongside this file.

* a PHP5 interpreter

* OpenLayers-2.4. Put the Open layers collection of Javascript files in a directory in www and set the location in the configuratin file (see below). Alternatively these could be dragged in from another server.

* classysql.php. This is a set of classes which does for PHP something
similar to what Rails does for Ruby. See below. This is supplied.

* the system uses a directory dblog, which needs to be writable by the web server.

Licence

This program creates and provides access to a name index derived from OpenStreetMap map data.

Configuration
-------------

The index.html file is really a php file in disguise. You will need a
.htaccess file to set the file types to be processed by PHP. There is
a template for this (dot.htaccess.template) in www. Copy this to www
and amend appropriately.

There is a configuraton file for things like the database user name
and password, location of various bits of the system etc, called
.config.php. There is a template for this: dot.config.php in www. Copy
this to .config.php and amend appropriately.

Build the database
------------------

Run import .php like this, cd'd to utils
  php5 -d memory_linmit=128M import.php planet-070813.osm
(or whatever you php interpreter is called). Make sure the planet file
has the date in it, as exported from osm, as this is used to determine
the date of the index.

You might want to run this as a background job redirecting output to a
log file. 

Then run 
  php5 -d memory_linmit=128M update.php

Once run on a planet file updates can be run from the regular diff files to 
update the database.

See the wiki pages for more details.

Classysql
---------

This utility code is a separate project which provides class oriented
MySQL database facilities to client PHP code. It is separately
licensed.

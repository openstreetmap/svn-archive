The contents of this folder deal with daily updates.

Change the name of the mail recipient in the mail command in
update.sh! Also change the mail recipient and database locations and
passwords at the top of daily.php.

This simple script will run the php program daily.php which will
analyze what new update files are available. New files will be
downloaded and unprocessed but already downloaded files will be
processed. daily.php generates another script update-daily.sh to
process the determined files, using the utilities import.php and
update.php in the main part of the system (in the utils folder).

Completed files are flagged with .done suffixes. For that reason, once
primed from a complete planet file, any available updates already
included in the planet file should be prevented from updating by
adding (empty) files of the form
"daily-20080801-20080802.osc.bz2.done" to the folder.

Create a folder "donelog" for the script to store log files.

Then update.sh should be run daily from cron.

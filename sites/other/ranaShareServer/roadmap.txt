Things to do with the share server in future:

Public-key encrypted groups:

  There is no reason why the server should be able to read your position - make the groups allow uploading of reports encrypted with the group's public key.

Share vector data:

  Sketches, routes, waypoints, tracklogs...

Text messaging:

  Set your 'status' (exactly the same conceptually as setting your nickname) so that people in the group can read something about you (e.g. your ETA to some meeting)

Map errors:

  Allow map errors to be reported via this interface, e.g. to openstreetbugs

And more...

Database changes
================

We need one extra table that can answer the question "What ways use
node X?" quickly:

CREATE TABLE `nodedep` (
 `node` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
 `way` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
 KEY `node` (`node`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=ascii COLLATE=ascii_bin;

create/node
===========

 just like in nodes.pl:

 INSERT INTO nodepos VALUES ($id, $x,$y,$tx$ty)

modify/node
===========

 UPDATE nodepos SET VALUES ($id, $x, $y, $tx$ty) where ID=$id

 dirtyNode{$id} = 1

delete/node
===========

 DELETE FROM nodepos WHERE ID=$id

 TODO: are we sure ways that depend on this node have been deleted before?

create/way
==========

 just like in ways.pl:

 INSERT INTO wayloc VALUES (?,?)
 INSERT INTO waydata VALUES (?,?)
 (and nodedep too)

 TODO: are we sure all nodes used by this way have already been added?

modify/way
==========

 delete way
 add the way again

handling dirty ways
===================

When location of a node changes a way becomes dirty. This is bit
tricky: we can't just delete/re-add ways normally since the diff does
not have enough information for re-adding them. We need to backup old
waydata and reconstruct the new way using that info.

for n in keys(dirtyNode) {
  SELECT way FROM nodedep WHERE node=$n
   dirtyWay{$way} = 1
}

for n in keys(dirtyWay) {
  SELECT data FROM waydata WHERE id=$n
    old_waydata = $data
    delete way
    ....    

}

TODO:
 if N1 is part of W1
  modify/node N1
  modify/way W1

 W1 is dirty even after it has been updated to reflect changes in N1
 since we only track dirty nodes and only later figure out what ways
 are affected. Maybe modify/way should set some $refreshedWay[$ID]?

delete/way
==========

 DELETE FROM wayloc WHERE way=$id
 DELETE FROM waydata WHERE id=$id
 DELETE FROM nodedep WHERE way=$id

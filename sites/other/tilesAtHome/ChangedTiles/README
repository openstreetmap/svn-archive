index.php

This file can be called more often than the configured interval, since it
won't add Tilejobs where they already exist.

it should be called at least once per interval, preferrably from cron.
Current interval is 4 hours.

example cron entry (paths need adapting!)
0 */4 * * * ~/public_html/ChangedTile/dailytiles.sh

The file may also be called via webserver, it does not harm (other than
consume server resources) operations for the reasons stated above.

<p>The <a href="Recent/">latest 30 requests in each queue</a> are available (which used to be displayed on this page)</p>

<p>Munin has a <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/munin/openstreetmap/dev.openstreetmap-tilesathome.html">page for these graphs</a>, and for <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/munin/openstreetmap/dev.openstreetmap.html">the dev server</a> in general</p>
  
<h2>Notes</h2>
  
<ul>
<li><b>Pending</b> requests are created when you ask for an area to be rerendered. (see the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Tiles%40home/APIs">API</a> if you want to know how to make those requests)</li>

<li><b>New</b> requests are pretty similar to pending ones, in that they get downloaded by tiles@home clients.  In this case, <b>new</b> means that it's been re-requested.</li>

<li><b>Active</b> requests have been taken by tiles@home clients to render</li>

<li><b>Done</b> means the result has been uploaded, and the request is effectively closed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>So what does that mean?</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Green goes up</b> - something's been requested</li>

<li><b>Green to red</b> - tiles@home client has taken a request</li>

<li><b>Red to blue</b> - they failed to upload, and it's been put back in the queue</li>

<li><b>Blue to red</b> - client has taken a request that someone else failed to do</li>

<li><b>Red to turquoise</b> - a successful rendering</li>

<li><b>Turquoise goes down</b> - requests from two days ago got cleared-out of the done queue</li>

</ul>

<h3>What's the difference between new and pending?</h3>

<p>Nothing really. There was an idea to use it for some sort of delay mechanism, so that multiple low-priority automated requests for the same area could be grouped together.  That's probably not going to happen though.</p>

<h3>Request timeouts</h3>

<p>After 6 hours in the <b>active</b> queue, requests are moved to the <b>new</b> queue.  This is when someone said that they'd render something but failed to upload the result</p>

<p>After 2 &times; 24 hours in the <b>done</b> queue, requests are deleted.</p>

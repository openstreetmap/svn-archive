t@h server
==========
 - Nicer User statistics
 - Discard incomplete tileset uploads (mail user?)
 - Prevent duplicate requests
 - Make request handler smarter (use priorities etc)
 - Make upload processor smarter (use upload priorities)
 - Implement dead-simple re-requester on failure first. Then move on to next item.
 - Make use of client feedback (re-render on error)
 - Make use of complexity that client can handle
 - Reimplement MapOf or try to integrate the existing PHP version at the current location.
 - Actually save the user id who uploaded a tileset in the tileset file
 - Make the lowzoom tile stitcher automatically run on updated tilesets. Right now a complete run  takes 2 days.


t@h client
==========

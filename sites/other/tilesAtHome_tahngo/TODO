t@h server
==========
 - Discard incomplete tileset uploads (mail user?)
 - Make upload processor smarter (use upload priorities)
 - Make the clients 'put job back to server' actually work. Right now, it's
   just not possible to rerequest a job where the server thinks it is still in
   progress.
 - Make use of client feedback (re-render on error)
 - Make use of complexity that client can handle and only hand out to clients that can.
 - Send a "Last-Modified" header back with the Tile files. (Expires, Last Modified, Etag HTTP headers)
 - Fixup lowzoom stitching to look good, so we can do that server side again.
 - Nicer User statistics

t@h client (will not be implemented by spaetz)
==========
 - Ditch the token stuff, it's unused
 - implement "I'm still on it" pinging
 - implement other feedback "error reasons"
 - ditch the sleep() after upload. It's not needed.

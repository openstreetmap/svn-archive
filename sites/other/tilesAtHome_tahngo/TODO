t@h server
==========
NOTE, spaetz will be gone Aug 1st-Aug 18th, so he won't be able to do something during that time!

 - Enable logging in the server and log all kinds of client errors (no-data, ...)
 - make feedback URL use client authentication
 - check for client Version
 - Check the "LayerCapabilities" of the client and only send appropriate requests.
 - Discard incomplete tileset uploads (mail user?)
 - Make use of complexity that client can handle and only hand out to clients that can.
 - Fixup lowzoom stitching to look good, so we can do that server side again. (nearly there)
 - Fix MapOf to return the exact excerpt.

t@h client (will not be implemented by spaetz)
==========
 - generally go through the code and remove superfluous code (e.g. non-tileset uploads)
 - implement "I'm still on it" pinging
 - Send the current client version as data (or other numeric) string that we can compare against. We don't want to maintain a list of city names in the server.

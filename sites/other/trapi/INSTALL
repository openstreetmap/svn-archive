Trapi has only been tested on Debian unstable on x86 machines, but
should work on any modern unix-derived OS.  For Debian, you will need
the packages listed in packages.  (or equivelents if you prefer
another web server than apache2.)  The data files are
endian-independent.  Porting to Microsoft would be a challenge, there
are subtle dependencies on a reasonable OS.

The time on the system should be close to correct.  If it is off by
more than a minute it could affect the data update process.  The map
fcgi-bin program will refuse to serve data if the clock is too far in
the future.

ptdb.pm has several constants defined, most of which shouldn't be
touched.  VERBOSE is for how many messages to output.  1 will be only
detected problems in the data, 25 will be many debugging messages.
TRAPIDIR is where the trapi data files are stored, which should be on
a filesystem set up for many small files.  If using ext2 or ext3,
directory indexing should be on and using a 1 or 2kbyte allocation
will save disk space.  DBDIR is for the indexes that are larger files.
MAXOPEN is the number of data files to open at once, not including the
indexes.  Bigger is generally better if your OS can handle it.
KEEPOPEN should be a bit less, closer to MAXOPEN will mean more CPU
and less file opening.  SPLIT is the number of bytes in a node data
file before splitting to higher zoom.  IGNORETAGS is a regular
expression to match tags that will not be stored in the database.
(Use '^$' to store all tags.)


All programs except map assume they are running in TRAPIDIR.

Initial data load:

   cleardb
   bzcat planet.bz2 | tahdbload.pl
   echo YYYYMMDD >timestamp

YYYYMMDD is the day before the planet file was generated.  It's better
to reprocess a bit of duplicated data than miss something.  The
initial data load is disk IO intensive and will take several days.


Updating the data:

   trup.pl | trpcs.pl

This will fetch the daily, hourly, and minute diff files and update
the trapi database.  It will complete processing the currently fetched
data then stop if the file stopfile.txt exists.  timestamp will be
updated as the diff files are processed.


Garbage collection:

   trgarb.pl

Garbage collection must be done when nothing else is updating the
database.  It takes a little over a day.  How often this should be
done is to be determined.  stopfile.txt will stop the garbage
collection.


Web access:

map is a fastcgi script.  Your web server should be configured so
api/0.5/map?bbox= requests will go to it.



Trapi will return more data than requested.  All request are rounded
up to z14 tile boundaries, and in low node density areas may be up to
z11.  Some tags not used by tiles@home are not stored by trapi.  The
user and timestamp information is also not stored.  This is fine for
tiles@home, but trapi data must not be uploaded to openstreetmap.
Ways and relations that are no longer in the requested area may be
returned.

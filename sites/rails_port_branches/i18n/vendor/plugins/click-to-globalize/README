ClickToGlobalize
================

Click to Globalize is an extension for Globalize plugin, it allows to edit in
place globalized labels. With this plugin you don't have to create a
globalization back-end, but just edit your interface in place!!

If you have a previous globalization experience, you probably noticed that the
main problem of dedicated back-ends is the lack of the context where the
string will be placed in. It isn't a trivial issue: you'll never know if the
meaning of your string is harmonious with other labels and how your string will
be rendered, until the page load.

Now you can forget this issues, you can directly globalize in place!!

Uninstall
=========

1. $ ./script/plugin remove click-to-globalize

Features
========

* In place editing for each globalized string.

* Easy and painless plug-in/plug-out process.

* Unobtrusive Javascripts.

* Textile and Markdown support.

* Auto transformation from input text to textarea for long strings.

Common Issues
=============

* Since the Globalize plugin creates folders like 'for-1.2', be sure to rename
  the folder to 'globalize'.

* Due to unobtrusive nature of the plugin, each page is parsed by javascript
  to find the right element and bind to it an Ajax.InPlaceEditor.
  Be sure your (X)HTML is wellformed.

  NOTE: If you use the Rails scaffold system, Click To Globalize
  doesn't works. Cleanup the code before to use.

* If you use a wiki-formatting style it could be advisable to use #h to avoid
  security problems (i.e. XSS).
  <%= textilize(h('some_text'.t)) %>

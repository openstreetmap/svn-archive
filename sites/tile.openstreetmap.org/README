this stuff is _extremely_ hacky but it works.

A ruby script (render_some_tiles) is called by cron every 10 minutes or whatever
it calls another script to get some tiles from a db
it pipes those in to a python script to render them
the python script then calls a ruby script to insert them back in to the db

feel free to rewrite all of this in to one python script

the db has a 'dirty' attribute which is turned true if the tile doesnt exist or is older than a week by the script which serves out tiles (cat_tile.rb). The other scripts grab a 1000 tiles at a time and render them.

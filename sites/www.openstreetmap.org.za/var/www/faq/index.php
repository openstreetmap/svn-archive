                <h1>FAQs: Questions and Answers</h1>

                <h2><a id="what_is_osm" name="was_ist_osm">What is OpenStreetMap?</a></h2>
                <p class="answer">
					OpenStreetMap is a project with the goal of creating a free world map. 
					We collect worldwide data on roads, railways, rivers, forests, homes and everything else, what is commonly seen on maps. 
					Because we collect the data themselves and not from existing maps abmalen, we have even all rights therein. 
					The OpenStreetMap data may lizenzkostenfrei each, and any further. 
                </p>

                <h2><a id="warum" name="warum">Why do you?</a></h2>
                <p class="answer">
					Geodata is rarely free these days. 
					If a local map on its homepage or in a printing unit volumes, you can often only through a shopping (sometimes very expensive) license for proprietary card material.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					The same applies to research and teaching. 
					Who for teaching a constituency card or the like is required, often fall back on proprietary data - or moves on legal thin ice.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					If a navigation unit acquires and pays a significant price for the accompanying digital maps.
					Often, only after buying out that the material is incomplete and outdated.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					OpenStreetMap ended their dependence on proprietary data providers and sets the pure consuming creative activity. 
					Through the cooperation of the members is a free spatial data bank, all the world's people available.
                </p>

                <h2><a name="google">But isn't Google Maps free?</a></h2>

                <p class="answer">
					The use of Google maps (as well as that of many other suppliers) is free but not free. Google also continues conditions on the use of his cards. 
					In general, the cards that you find on the Internet, the use of the websites or the API of the provider. 
					Even such a map to print and distribute is often not allowed.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					In addition, Google Maps is available, but not the underlying spatial information.
					You can use the cards only to use as they are offered.
					If the cards in another style or will you have your own routing algorithm to try to get it no further.
					OpenStreetMap also offers the "raw" spatial data, so that everyone can use them as he wishes.
                </p>

                <h2><a name="wie_mitmachen">How can I join?</a></h2>

                <p class="answer">
					Most members of the OSM community participate by mapping, so the fact that with a GPS map data and collect OpenStreetMap. 
					Many draw also approved aerial photographs and complete data on the spot. Even assistance in "small style" is for the project is very valuable: Are the areas in which you are familiar properly covered, or you find errors, you could improve? You Arbeitest perhaps even with the Post Office and know a lot of house numbers by heart?
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					Also in OpenStreetMap programmers are always appreciated, there is a lot to do - to the central database, the editors, software, which zeichet cards, and all possible assistance programmes.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					Did you perhaps access to data, the OpenStreetMap use?
					Aerial photos, old maps, whose copyrights have expired, or the GPS tracks your fleet of courier vehicles?
					Always her so, we can certainly use somewhere.
                </p>

                <h2><a name="brauche_ich_gps">Do I need a GPS?</a></h2>
                <p class="answer">
					The data collection with GPS is one of the ways OpenStreetMap the database filled, but by far not the only one.
					Even if you do not have GPS, you can at the other data processing involved, or in areas where OpenStreetMap has already been collected, the quality check or personal knowledge involved.
                </p>

                <h2><a name="wie_daten_nutzen">How can I use the data?</a></h2>
                <p class="answer">
					OpenStreetMap itself offers the data collected either in or in the form of crude vorberechneter card images.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					To view or to quickly and easily a card on their own site, are the precalculated card best images (including the <a href="/map/">map on OpenStreetMap.org.za</a> works with it).
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
					Those who own calculations with the data cards or would like to reflect in a self-defined style will produce the finished card is used instead of images the raw data.
					The raw data can be downloaded regularly updated file (the so-called <a href="http://planet.openstreetmap.org/">"planet file"</a> with the data of the whole world, or <a href="http://roland-ramthun.de/osm/extracts/south-africa/">extracts from it</a>, with individual files for various European countries).
					For smaller cuttings (until about 1000 square kilometers, less in areas with high data density) are the raw data directly via the Web interface to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">www.openstreetmap.org</a> ("export" tab).
                </p>

                <h2><a name="lizenz">What is with the license?</a></h2>

                <p class="answer">
Jeder darf also zum Beispiel einen Fahrradatlas
mit OSM-Karten produzieren und verkaufen &ndash; solange er dazu schreibt, dass die Daten von OSM kommen
und solange der Fahrradatlas seinerseits die CC-BY-SA-Lizenz hat (das bedeutet wiederum: Jeder
darf den Fahrradatlas kopieren oder als Basis f체r eigene Werke nutzen). Die Lizenz verh채lt sich

                <h2><a name="wie_vollstaendig">How complete is the data?</a></h2>
                <p class="answer">
					We need to gegenfragen: What is "completely"? All highways and federal roads? Or all cycling and mailboxes? 
					Each house number and every park bench? - The detail of the OSM regional data is very different. 
					In many cities, we are already better than most proprietary cards - but elsewhere, we have a white spot or only a transit road, where an entire city actually belongs.
					Anyone who wants to use our data, itself a picture of whether they are for the targeted purpose "sufficiently complete". If not: Just a month later hingucken again!
                </p>

                <h2 class="question"><a name="wieviele_leute">How many people are participating in OpenStreetMap?</a></h2>
                <p class="answer">
					Worldwide (as of April 2008) about 30,000 people a OpenStreetMap account. Of these, in the last month about 10% actively. 
					The number of Mitmacher is growing rapidly.

                <h2 class="question"><a name="wie_finanziert">How financed?</a></h2>
                <p class="answer">
					All work in the project is done by volunteers to make no money.
					The server on which the database and other key services are running, are partly sponsored, in part by individual project members from their own pockets paid.
					In Britain, there is a OpenStreetMap Association, the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Foundation">Open Street Map Foundation</a>, which is a low level of donations occupies.
					Individual events are sometimes sponsored by interested companies.

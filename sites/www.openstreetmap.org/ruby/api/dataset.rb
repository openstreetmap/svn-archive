# Parses a complete OSM 0.2 format XML document containing both nodes and
# segments.
# If the node IDs are negative, and corresponding negative node IDs are
# present in the segments, it will be assumed that the user is uploading new
# nodes and segments. New nodes will be created and segments will be formed 
# between the new nodes. Each new node will be reallocated a real, positive ID.
# For example, if the file
#
# <osm version='0.2'>
# <node lat='51' lon='-1' uid='-1'/>
# <node lat='51.01' lon='-1.01' uid='-2'/>
# <node lat='51.04' lon='-1.02' uid='-3'/>
# <node lat='51.09' lon='-1.03' uid='-4'/>
# <node lat='52' lon='0' uid='200000' />
# <segment from='-1' to='-2'/>
# <segment from='-2' to='-3'/>
# <segment from='-3' to='-4'/>
# </osm>
#
# is uploaded, four new nodes (the ones with supplied uid of -1 to -4) will
# be created, one existing node (200000) will be updated, and three segments
# will be formed between the four new nodes.
# The real, positive node IDs allocated to the new nodes (with supplied
# negative IDs) will be returned as standard output.

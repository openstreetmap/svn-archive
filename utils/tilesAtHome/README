== Getting Started == 

To use this copy the correct config template to tilesAtHome.conf then edit
to set you username and password (both for osm data and for tiles upload)

== Running the client ==

to start generating tiles run "tilesGen.pl" CAUTION: if your country uses 
a comma for decimal separator (like Germany) you need to set LANG=C 
beforehand on unix-like systems. If you don't do this inkscape will complain 
and generate empty tiles.
if you want to render a specific tile run tilesGen.pl with the xy option
for example if you want to render the tile number x=2148 y=1332 
(zoom 12 is always the default and cannot be changed) you would run
./tilesGen.pl xy 2148 1332

to upload tiles use "upload.pl"

(might need multiple calls to upload everything, depending on your setup)
